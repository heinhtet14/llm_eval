The good: price, location, dessert (recommended food items are: baked chicken, fried chicken, potatoes, Salad, meat and cheese, pizza) also our waitress was great. The normal: behind the counter meat slicing station, shrimp (not even deshelled), Mexican station. The bad: breakfast -worst eggs ever, actually worst, eggs. The chef can't even cut through ham or hard bread (tried on all 3 occasions), beef, shrimp again. As for decoration, it's the 1970 nightmare you can imagine.",

    "review_text": "We started with the burger set, a big mistake. It was cold and the fries were old. Mentioned to our waitress, but nothing came of it.  We ordered a large thin pizza which was a bit pricey after adding toppings. Pizza was ok, not great. Aside from not being our advocate, our server was good.  I have been here before for a football game, it was better then. Will try another venue next time.",
