I like to buy local whenever I can and this store reminds me a lot of REI but with the added bonus of being locally owned. I've always received outstanding customer service and found the staff to go out of their way to find a solution for me. I just finished my holiday shopping here because they have a ton of little things that make great stocking stuffers for anyone like balms, solar lights for camping, doggy gear, kid stuff, etc. I often like to gauge a business by the happiness of its employees and when I talk with them about working at Rutabaga, they never hesitate to sing the praises of this very cool store. Looking forward to my next visit!",
