I have been waiting over two weeks for him to tell us how much he's going to charge us why they have held our deposit. Hardly picks up Phone never calls back rarely is there.... Looked at all the good reviews thought it was a good place but I've had the worst experience ever.. By far the worst company I've ever dealt with.. Be careful!",

    "review": "We were out at the lake this weekend boating and towed a jet ski rented from Jet Action back to the dock.  Things happen, but when I called the office to help make arrangements for the couple \"stuck\" in the middle of the lake, I was treated rudely and told that \"these things don't break down so I don't know what to tell you.\"  No suggestions or assistance was offered. I would NOT rent here.  Unhelpful and very rude.",

    "review": "this place is an absolute joke. it's extremely overpriced ($12 for a solo ham and cheese crepe you have got to be kidding me), the menu is extremely limited, and the food is just plain not up to par. seriously--if you're going to try to make a place 'hip' or upscale and charge those kinds of prices, you've got to make the experience worth it. i honestly don't know what the people raving about this place are talking about when it comes to the most delicious food they've ever had. the crepe i had was waaaay too salty, and their bloody marys tasted like they were made of pickle juice. neither i nor the person i was dining with were impressed, and, needless to say, we won't be showing up again.",
