    "review": "Phenomenal locally owned store for outdoor enthusiasts. I like to buy local whenever I can and this store reminds me a lot of REI but with the added bonus of being locally owned. I've always received outstanding customer service and found the staff to go out of their way to find a solution for me. I just finished my holiday shopping here because they have a ton of little things that make great stocking stuffers for anyone like balms, solar lights for camping, doggy gear, kid stuff, etc. I often like to gauge a business by the happiness of its employees and when I talk with them about working at Rutabaga, they never hesitate to sing the praises of this very cool store. Looking forward to my next visit!",

    "review": "The owners Chris and joe were extremely nice. They took my reservation without a credit card. I rented two decent wave runners for $125 each for the whole day. $300 deposit on each. Brought them back at 5.30 in the same condition I picks them up. TheY threw in the life jackets and a hitch and trailer for the skis. This really is the best deal in town and 33 minute drive to the lake. Awesome day on the lake",

    "review": "Friend found this place for our yearly trip to Lake Mead.   We have rented from other local places and these guys are very nice and informal.  No long video to watch and we're not overly suspicious of us.  Skis were in good shape and ran well all weekend. They worked with us on return time.   Easy transaction.  I left $300 which I got back the same 3 hundred bills I left.   Chris and Joe are great and plan on using them on all our future trips.",

( sorry... all sausage boats not allowed)- extra alcohol and a pack of cigarettes or some nice cigars make your neighbors friendlier- don't even bother bringing your inner tube or wake board. this is all chillin' and boat hopping.....",
