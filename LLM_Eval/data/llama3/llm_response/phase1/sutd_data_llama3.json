    "review": "Straight to the point, it's cheap, it tastes and feels cheap. The good: price, location, dessert (recommended food items are: baked chicken, fried chicken, potatoes, Salad, meat and cheese, pizza) also our waitress was great. The normal: behind the counter meat slicing station, shrimp (not even deshelled), Mexican station. The bad: breakfast -worst eggs ever, actually worst, eggs. The chef can't even cut through ham or hard bread (tried on all 3 occasions), beef, shrimp again. As for decoration, it's the 1970 nightmare you can imagine.",

    "review": "We started with the burger set, a big mistake. It was cold and the fries were old. Mentioned to our waitress, but nothing came of it.  We ordered a large thin pizza which was a bit pricey after adding toppings. Pizza was ok, not great. Aside from not being our advocate, our server was good.  I have been here before for a football game, it was better then. Will try another venue next time.",

    "review": "My menu is coconut soup and pat thai with protein. I tried the same menu here. Actually really like their coconut soup. They used enough coconut milk that the soup was really creamy and not overpowered with herbs. I'm so used to Americanized Thai cuisine that I prefer fewer herbs on my dish. Pat Thai was great too. I liked the amount of peanuts they used, the noodles were chewy and perfect and not too sweet. They gave me a generous amount of chicken and white meat was not dry so I was very happy with my meal.",

I also ordered some hot wings and they were pretty good. They had a ton of sauce which is awesome. Next time I come back to town I will definitely stop here for more pizza!",

    "review": "We had a party of 6 here for hibachi. Our waitress put our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn't really tell who was who and forgot several items on one order. I understand that I made mistakes but the restaurant was very quiet so we were a bit surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our chef said maybe three words but he cooked very well, his name was Francisco. The service was lazy, the food was pretty good and I hope it was just a free night here. But for the money I wouldn't go again.",
    "Version1": "Disappointing hibachi experience with service issues",
    "Version2": "Quiet evening at a usually lively spot",

    "review": "I enjoyed \"Pleiades Rising\" for several reasons. A strong, 17 year old narrator describes her adventurous summer before beginning college in southern California. An archeological discovery along with astronomical and spiritual interventions propel Maggie and her friend Will to travel to Mexico. As the mystery behind their find deepens and the action increases, I felt that I was actually along for the ride. Just the right touch of love interest to pull in young romantics.",
