      "review_text": "This place sucks and they lie.My nephew and his bride were here from England and my wedding gift for them was a day out on the like with jet skis.I called on Saturday sept 8th and got some Aussie guy on the phone who took my reservation for 2 jet skis the following morning at 8am, and also took my credit card info.When we arrived at 8 am the guy in the shop had no idea about our reservation. He had to call the Aussie guy, who then must have remembered me from the night before. Well it was raining on that morning and boulder highway had a section closed due to a marathon race. So the guy in the shop told me that they were not renting that day due to the fact that lake mead was closed.I'd never heard of this before, but I was disappointed and left. My nephew and his bride were upset, but we moved on. I then saw a cop, by the closed section of the highway and asked him if lake mead was in fact closed. He said no and there were two other alternate routes to get there.So this skiwi rental place flat out lied to us. I ended up renting a couple of high powered skis from their competition who couldn't believe they did that to us, and he gave us a discount. Go with vegas jet ski rental. Much more professional and don't lie to their customers and tell them the lake is closed.Btw, the weather got beautiful later that day and we all had the best day.",

There are several opinions, including my husbands (a former mechanic) that the boot was not securely fastened and therefore leaked. We are long time boaters and our last out drive lasted 13 years and is now happily serving someone else. This almost took out the entire unit and it was saved and now runs better than ever by another mechanic for a mere 900! Thank heavens. These guys were sadly typical. They always had a new excuse to charge us more.. And that would be fine if they did the job, but the service was poor quality! Save yourself grief and go to Gerry's Marine instead, he's awesome!
