    "review": "I've done quite a bit of canoeing and kayaking - lakes, rivers, whitewater, but, never actually owned my own Kayak.  I live on the Sugar River and was looking for a nice boat that had a good balance of maneuverability, stability, tracking, and efficiency so I could use it on the river but, also take it on nice paddles on lakes.The staff were excellent about helping me and very patient as I tried numerous boats, over and over and over, at their test area located on the channel between Lake Monona and Upper Mud Lake on the Yahara.  In the end, I ended up picking the boat that TWO staff people first recommended right from the start.  They listened to my needs, helped me extensively, and made some really good recommendations for selection of a paddle and other accessories.I've since purchased the boat and have had MANY opportunities to paddle it - on flat water, rivers, and some small rapids.  The boat has been great for me.I will definitely come back - we are looking at another purchase for my wife.",
