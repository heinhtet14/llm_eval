The good: price, location, dessert (recommended food items are: baked chicken, fried chicken, potatoes, Salad, meat and cheese, pizza) also our waitress was great. The normal: behind the counter meat slicing station, shrimp (not even deshelled), Mexican station. The bad: breakfast -worst eggs ever, actually worst, eggs. The chef can't even cut through ham or hard bread (tried on all 3 occasions), beef, shrimp again. As for decoration, it's the 1970 nightmare you can imagine."

Get up and go across the yard to get it. If you want a drink, go downstairs and pay in cash. Want to sit in dirty deckchairs in a dirty garden, enjoy yourself. The waiters are a little bit helpful as they bring you your food after you go to the window and pay cash for it. Kind of like New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but dirty and with live music (which is nice). It's a once in a lifetime experience for me... just once."

It describes the Vikings routes to America before Columbus and the Zeno Narrative of travels with Henry Sinclair. I am also a student of Scottish History and i find it most credible that they discovered America first. Sinclair was involved with Templars and the Masons. The book is an eye opener and rewrites history with compelling evidence - Newport Tower and Westford Knight grave stone. I don't know when schools will teach this stuff but it needs to be soon."

Because it is a gift, I do not know how much detail it goes into about history, but I do know from the way my sister-in-law described the pictures, that she was pleased with all of the detail they picked up, especially the details in the costumes.

That is to say that the basic history of American Government is pretty straightforward; we've only been around 200 years as a country. So the book has a lot of filler in it. The real zinger is the price. I paid $180 for this book at the campus bookstore. Amazon has it for around $160. The buyback here is $26 bucks! $26 bucks!Everything covered in this book is basic high school civics. The high price goes to pay the very high \"tax\" of going to college."

Highly recommended."

The first is that it breaks down the issue of fatalism in such a way that is easy to understand, and yet it does not sacrifice truth at the altar of understanding. The second thing that it achieves is that it explains both good and bad proposed solutions to the problem. To conclude, Bill Craig has done a masterful job of explicating the issue.If one is looking for another book written on this subject by the same author that is more technical and rigorous, see Craig's \"Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom\" in Brill's Studies in Intellectual History."

However, naarad said that he read a better version of Rayaman written by Hanuman. When Valmiki read this version of Ramayan, which was written on leaves, he started to cry. Hanuman took these banana leaves and ate them.I definitely love this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes historical books."

For example when the chapter of Alexander and India it talks about the battle of Hydaspes River and then all of a sudden goes back to the start of the invasion and then talks about the battle again. I learned that Alexander was not only an amazing tactician, but also a kind man to some people. I would recommend this book to those who like ancient history and have enough time on their hands to read it. Yes I would say this book is \"Important\" for people who have been able to achieve so much should be remembered and this book goes into great detail of Alexander."

My mistake! Christine Miller rewrote Guerber's original to reflect her fundamentalist Protestant beliefs, including that Creation occurred in 4004 BC and that the patriarchs, starting with Adam, wrote down their own family history and handed the sacred books down from one generation to the next. The history of other societies in the Near East is changed to accommodate Miller's chronology. If you are looking for biblical history, stick with the original Guerber."

Not only are his works among the finest in comics history, unique in their depth, conviction and intellect, but Moore as a person is similarly one-of-a-kind. The interviews collected here present Moore on a range of subjects and span most of his career. The book is well worth the attention of anyone interested in Moore's work, or comics in general. A handy tome featuring some of Moore's finest interviews, this collection is a welcome addition to any Alan Moore library. Buy it."

You'll meet up in front of a grocery store (seems strange at first, but it's not terribly hard to find, and it'll give you a chance to get some water), and you'll stop at a visitor center part way through the tour for a bathroom break if needed.

The cheese was good, but none of the other toppings added much flavor.  There was no red sauce as is typical for a true margherita pizza.

I LOVE the 96th street Naked Tchopstix so I was very excited to see this one which is closer to my house.\nThe vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it.\nMy daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry and it was quite yummy. Next time I am going to try the vanilla chai."

As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn't be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced."

Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. \nI also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing.

Yelp steered us in the Jasmine Rice direction, and it was definitely a good decision. We wanted the summer rolls, which were on the menu, but apparently will not be available until summer, so we settled on the pan-fried dumplings. The flavor was good, but I don't think we'd order them again. We got the green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai. Both of those dishes were great, but the duck stole the show. That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late). Another person who got take-out was missing one of their items (but the owner realized it and called him and walked the dish to his house, which was very nice). Overall, good quality Thai! We would definitely go back."

    "interview_data": "I LOVE Weaver's Way and really disagree with some of the content in previous reviews. WW is not necessarily meant for convenience shopping. I am a single woman and I find that I have no trouble shopping at the co-op, during peak times or otherwise. I actually find the co-op to be a great place to shop if you live alone because I can get smaller quantities of items than if I shop at the corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children\", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family. I don't think that membership in a co-op is for everyone and, if you aren't single, it's definitely not a solo decision. If you're keen on being committed to the Weaver Way values, you couldn't find a better place to shop. If not, stick to the chain stores or just pay the 10% visitors' fee to pop in once in a while."

We ordered a salsa trio (which included 3 samples of the various salsas, in 2oz glass prep bowls), and when my brother asked for more salsa for his tacos (mind you, we ordered one of ever taco, three burritos and guacamole), he was told he'd have to buy the trio again!

I needed a PA State & Emissions  inspection which I dread because they can be a total ripoff at some places when they add things on and I just wanted to get it over with.  I saw that this place had much better reviews on Yelp than many other shops in the area.  Keystone Discount Tire took my 2008 Pontiac Torrent in for inspection while I waited and had some free coffee.  I only had to get up once to look at some irregular outer front tire wear on my car when it was on the rack during inspection.  I always appreciate it when the technician lets me look at the problem.   It was nothing major.  Easily correctable with an alignment sometime in the future.  Bill was very friendly, knowledgable, and straightforward with his overall analysis of my car.  My car was fully inspected and stickered in less than an hour without my bill being jacked up with add-ons.   I recommend getting on their mailing list for their coupons!!!!!!!!!!"

Reception was so nice immediately putting us at ease. As we checked in an attendant asked if Bentley could have treats which she fullly enjoyed. The Reception person also asked if we would like a welcome kit for Bentley. Holy moly. Of course. Dog dishes, a mat, treats, etc. I was blown away."

The good: price, location, dessert (recommended food items are: baked chicken, fried chicken, potatoes, Salad, meat and cheese, pizza) also our waitress was great. The normal: behind the counter meat slicing station, shrimp (not even deshelled), Mexican station. The bad: breakfast -worst eggs ever, actually worst, eggs. The chef can't even cut through ham or hard bread (tried on all 3 occasions), beef, shrimp again. As for decoration, it's the 1970 nightmare you can imagine."

I have been here before for a football game, it was better then. Will try another venue next time."

Get up and go across the yard to get it. If you want a drink, go downstairs and pay in cash. Want to sit in dirty deckchairs in a dirty garden, enjoy yourself. The waiters are a little bit helpful as they bring you your food after you go to the window and pay cash for it. Kind of like New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but dirty and with live music (which is nice). It's a once in a lifetime experience for me... just once."
