  "input_docs": "Straight to the point, it's cheap, it tastes and feels cheap. The good: price, location, dessert (recommended food items are: baked chicken, fried chicken, potatoes, Salad, meat and cheese, pizza) also our waitress was great. The normal: behind the counter meat slicing station, shrimp (not even deshelled), Mexican station. The bad: breakfast -worst eggs ever, actually worst, eggs. The chef can't even cut through ham or hard bread (tried on all 3 occasions), beef, shrimp again. As for decoration, it's the 1970 nightmare you can imagine. \n\n\nWe started with the burger set, a big mistake. It was cold and the fries were old. Mentioned to our waitress, but nothing came of it.  We ordered a large thin pizza which was a bit pricey after adding toppings. Pizza was ok, not great. Aside from not being our advocate, our server was good.  I have been here before for a football game, it was better then. Will try another venue next time.\n\n\nThis is a so-called restaurant that doesn't do anything a restaurant should do except preparing food, the rest is left to the guest. Do you want water? Get up and go across the yard to get it. If you want a drink, go downstairs and pay in cash. Want to sit in dirty deckchairs in a dirty garden, enjoy yourself. The waiters are a little bit helpful as they bring you your food after you go to the window and pay cash for it. Kind of like New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but dirty and with live music (which is nice). It's a once in a lifetime experience for me... just once.\n\n\nMy brother came to visit and we wanted to pick up a six pack of good beer for one night. We ended up staying and having a few while playing their Nintendo 64 (Super Smash Brothers which the owner said was donated by other customers). It's a great place with good food and really nice people. Should be a staple in the Northeast.\n\n\nMy menu is coconut soup and pat thai with protein. I tried the same menu here. Actually really like their coconut soup. They used enough coconut milk that the soup was really creamy and not overpowered with herbs. I'm so used to Americanized Thai cuisine that I prefer fewer herbs on my dish. Pat Thai was great too. I liked the amount of peanuts they used, the noodles were chewy and perfect and not too sweet. They gave me a generous amount of chicken and white meat was not dry so I was very happy with my meal.\n\n\nI stopped here because it was close to the hotel I was staying at. The people working in the store were super nice and friendly. I like the buy one get one offer they do. I also ordered some hot wings and they were pretty good. They had a ton of sauce which is awesome. Next time I come back to town I will definitely stop here for more pizza!\n\n\nJust started going to Sushi Nara this month (they only recently opened). I love this place; It's clean, the staff is friendly and courteous, and the service is quick. The sushi is always delicious (I've been here 3 times) and the prices are reasonable. In fact, my husband stopped by for take out this week, bought 4 sushi rolls and the total price was $24. That's incredible. I love the freshness of the food and there is a huge variety. Everyone on the east side, check out this place!\n\n\nWe had a party of 6 here for hibachi. Our waitress put our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn't really tell who was who and forgot several items on one order. I understand that I made mistakes but the restaurant was very quiet so we were a bit surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our chef said maybe three words but he cooked very well, his name was Francisco. The service was lazy, the food was pretty good and I hope it was just a free night here. But for the money I wouldn't go again.\n",

  "input_docs": "\"I enjoyed \"\"Pleiades Rising\"\" for several reasons. A strong, 17 year old narrator describes her adventurous summer before beginning college in southern California. An archeological discovery along with astronomical and spiritual interventions propel Maggie and her friend Will to travel to Mexico. As the mystery behind their find deepens and the action increases, I felt that I was actually along for the ride. Just the right touch of love interest to pull in young romantics.\"\r\n\"My book arrived promptly. I have not yet completed the book, but have found it to be very interesting so far. You are quickly transported back a 100 years in time as you realize there are no phones (only telegraphs and letters), news comes from the newspaper, people travel by train, cities are small, thieves were clever, and honest people were very trusting. The plot moves along quickly and the subjects in the book are interesting. The fun part of this book is that it is a real life adventure! I would definitely recommend it.\"\r\n\"Award-winning children's author, Mayra Calvani cleverly creates the world of water droplets and how they journey from the clouds to the earth and back to the clouds again. The Water Cycle: Water Play Series Book 1 children's weather book teaches the different stages of water through the creation of rain, hail, snow, water vapor and how each travels through our atmosphere. As an added bonus, the book includes a word search and word match activities to further guide children in understanding the water cycle.\"\r\n\"Frommer's France day by day is a respectable travel guide for France. It has nice full color photos, comes with a separate map, and has a lot of useful info in it.Unfortunately the book is far too brief - it is useful for planning a trip to France, but you'll definitely want books detailing each individual region you plan to visit. This is only to be expected - you can't really do a whole country in one short book.Overall the book is great for what it is - a broad overview of France. If you're planning a trip to France and haven't decided on exactly what to do, this is a great resource to use to narrow down your choices.\"\r\nI am a Mason and this book was very helpful to me. It describes the Templar visits to America before Columbus. In fact Columbus bore the Templar Cross on his ships and his father in law was a Mason. It describes the Vikings routes to America before Columbus and the Zeno Narrative of travels with Henry Sinclair. I am also a student of Scottish History and i find it most credible that they discovered America first. Sinclair was involved with Templars and the Masons. The book is an eye opener and rewrites history with compelling evidence - Newport Tower and Westford Knight grave stone. I don't know when schools will teach this stuff but it needs to be soon.\r\n\"Flores para los Muertos is a small but powerful book of very vibrant and well produced photographs of flower arrangements at the Key West Cemetery in Key West, Florida. Thousands of visitors to Key West visit the cemetery to wander through this facinating and historic place. The cemetery grounds are a feast to the eyes, as well as other senses. This little photo book takes you to this wonderful place and more. I recoomend this book to those who love photography, cemeteries- and love to travel.\"\r\n\"Not what I expected, it was a pleasant surprise. The Civil War battles are familiar topics, but the detail was more involved and personal to the characters than I had read previously. I did send a copy to my grandson who is a history buff in Gettysburg, Pa. where he has access to Civil War history at a local level. He quickly read it through, which whetted his appetite for more. He is 9 years old and more knowledgable than many older students when it comes to this part of history. Having traveled to Appotomax, and many other battlefields in Virginia made it easier to picture the area.Would highly recommend this to anyone interested in our country's history.\"\r\n\"I started reading this about 3 pm and couldn't put it down until I finished it! When I started reading, I thought I knew the plot and certainly how it would end. I was wrong.Leah is a strong woman in mid-life who has \"\"taken the road less traveled\"\" and takes us along with her as she travels to Spain and meets Miguel - who turns out to be many things - companion,lover,cad.Leah takes us on her journey with her relationship with Miguel - good and bad - and how she navigated her heartache while still keeping her center. Mature woman would love this read......I just have one question, what happened after the wedding, Leah? A sequel, I hope!\"\r\n\"I have been cycling, training, and racing for 25+ years. The information in this book is very useful. Some of it I have seen in my travels, however there is a lot of very useful information even with my many years of experience that I found useful and informative. I believe any athlete in any sport has to read, learn, study and then find the things that work for them. We are not all the same. We must use what works for us. Interpret and adapt! Well worth the read.\"\r\nI got this book as a gift when I moved to Utah. Four years later and it has traveled to every corner of the state with us. The author is from Utah and gives a great narrative on the different areas. There are great restaurants and awesome hiking trails mentioned. Sadly the binding glue failed on the book a couple years ago so I was on here looking for a new edition. Also At ten years old some of the information is a little dated.\r\n\"While traveling I bought this at a bookstore in the airport. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing. It is a very touching story and it is a good read, but the over use of the \"\"F\"\" word just didn't set well with me. I can handle most mild swearing, but this was way too much. I feel Matt could have told his story just as well without it. I have heard that you can tell the intelligence of a person by their language.....\"\r\n\"This is an excellent guide to practical information on the district of Goa, and the city of Mumbai. It describes both places with recommendations on hotels, sight-seeing, local customs and travel, but is short on history and other background information. The section on Goa is a bit more elaborate than the one on Mumbai. An excellent value for the price. I purchased a used volume (2009) and found it quite adequate.\"\r\n\"INSPIRINGIn 58 short chapters Barbara Wolf and Margaret Anderson offer descriptions of worldwide opportunities to help our world and ourselves in an amazing variety of ways. The truly international book is diffused with their personal experiences of helping others as they travelled extensively over many years. It is complete with names, addresses and WEB sites for contacting a wide variety of people and organizations. From a globally known pharmacy in the Amazon that sells medicine from rain forest medicinal plants to information about the Global Youth Action network, WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP OUR WORLD has something to offer every reader.Shirley Andrews, author, Concord, MA\"\r\n\"I first read this book over 25 years ago while traveling in Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. A trip I have made 14 times. I have also read stand-alone biographies of most of the great mountain men; Jedediah Smith, Hugh Glass, Jim Bridger, Kit Carson, Joe Meeks, Tom McDonald, and many more. I donated my collection of mountain men/indian biographies (over 30 volumes in all) to our local library.If you want to know more about these fascinating men and those times, this is by far the best and most readable place to begin.\"\r\n\"The Travel Bug series is a charming collection of books that will enchant readers of all ages: young, not-so-young, and anywhere in between. The characters - Buzworth and Nelson - seem very different at first glance, but soon learn through their adventures that their diversity is what brings them together. They become dependent on each other for their survival throughout the trials the harsh winter months bring them, and they soon become inseparable friends - an idea we could all learn from.The Travel Bug books will soon become a firm favourite with all readers and a regular request as a bedtime story.Mark - Angel Editing\"\r\n\"Charles Kuralt's adventures to nearly every corner of the world are most entertaining and at the same time very heartfelt.His story telling of so many places and the people he encounters leaves one envious of his occupation.We read of his early beginnings in journalism and then resulting assignments to various parts of the globe...the Viet Nam War, Brazil, Africa, Japan, Russia, etc.Kuralt's genius shines when he does his travels in the United States...the back roads. For those who remember his \"\"On the Road\"\" episodes and Sunday morning programs will not be disappointed. For those who are not familiar with Kuralt, this will be a welcoming read.\"\r\n\"Dear 20somethings, 30somethings, 40somethings, 50somethings, and Everyone-somethings:You will adore this book. It's entertaining, hilarious, and lighthearted. Faith's character is real and sassy -- she takes her raw dreams and transforms them into realistic possibility. By the end of this book, you will be rooting for her and her success. Great summer read -- by the beach, at the pool, while traveling, or just hanging out.\"\r\n\"We (men) sometimes think we knw what we are doing. Driving to someplace w/o a map will force us to pull over and ask for direction, but the Bible acts like a GPS (but better). It give us solid roads to travel on, allowing you/me to bypass pot holes in life (sins). This book is a tool to help men travel well in the jounery of life. I/we will be using this book as a Bible study. I'm lookiing fwd to it. Blessing to you in ur growth for a better CHRIST like life in a sinfull world. kj\"\r\n\"This brand new addition from Frommer's is chock full of info you'll want, to make your \"\"in the near future\"\" visit to Alaska a real treat. Within it's 550 pages, you'll find up-to-date information covering nearly everything you'll need, and more! They have even thrown in a new useful pull-out map. The text is easy to follow, and helps you avoid some of the common pit-falls tourists make. It features eleven tables-of-contents, and over 20 easy to use, new maps. Check some of the other Alaska books,and I think you'll agree that you can't go wrong with Frommer's latest edition on Alaska. Happy and safe travels !!\"\r\n\"I was a bit skeptical at first, but this story quickly draws you in, and it only gets better! It starts off simply enough, with a small group assembling to save the world. However, before you know it, there's a hurricane and the first character (a king) you meet dies! The knights travel on to discover islands of gargantuan monsters guarding dwarven caves, a race of winged beings with bad tempers, four pillars that hold up the sky, and a literal edge of the earth that you can fall right off of (and somebody who does)!Torjen is the first part of a trilogy, and I can't wait to read parts 2 and 3! Danny Cove sets the bar even higher for fantasy authors to aspire towards.\"\r\n\"This book is a delightful read. It mixes absurdity with real insight into the Parisians...As a frequent traveler to my favorite city, this is a great book for the air flight or to read in the evening after a day of wandering the City of Light. It both criticizes the Parisians and helps one laugh at attitudes. If you'd like something light and fun to read, both men and woman will enjoy this book!\"\r\n\"\"\"Threads of Life\"\" is like music to me, for there is a song for every mood and emotion. There is comfort and hope in knowing that someone else has traveled the same road and found hope and healing. It may not be exactly the same circumstance as the Author, but all the same emotions are present. My favorite is \"\"Frozen\"\" it touched me deeply. Now not just a song will come to mind when I feel one of these strong emotions, but the words of Jessica Kristie will draw me back to her book to once again find I am not alone.\"\r\n\"Good book for a tourist in a foreign country. Unfortunately, it didn't meet my needs. I would recommend this book to anyone who is traveling abroad, but if you're looking for something that offers more general phrases in everyday situations, than this isn't a good choice. There wasn't much there that I might use at work while conversing with my Latino coworkers. I can't say it's a bad book; it just didn't fulfill my expectations.\"\r\n\"This book contains alot of information about the entire park. Details are given about roads to travel on, weather conditions you might encounter at different times of year, places to eat and hike to, and even some road trips. The information so detailed that you can trust it as a handy guide as you travel the park. The other nice thing about the book is that it includes areas to see that you would probably never think of if all you did was take the Going to the Sun Road. There is so much more to explore in addition to that.\"\r\n\"It was an o.k. overview. The bias of some of the writers, though, seemed to come through, with tips on the best pubs and bars and higher priced restaurants but less on castles, ruins, abbeys, economical b&bs. Lonely Planet has always helped me economize when traveling with less expensive,though quirky accommodations and restaurants, so I was not completely satisfied with what this one had to offer.In addition, it was not as user friendly as some other publications, necessitating one to jump around from map to map when planning a tour itinerary.\"\r\n\"[[ASIN:0972386661 Putting God Into Einstein's Equations: Energy of the Soul]]I started off with Weiss- Past lives, advanced to Newton-Spirit World, and finally Jerry Pollock has gone where no one else has dared to travel, as he has explored past lives and the spirit world thru direct telepathic communication. One must keep an open mind as Jerry is brutally honest about his life which to me makes him real and honest as he speaks to the reader. Having read books by Weiss and Newton, I have progressed in my thinking whereby I am totally open to what Jerry has written. Take the next step and keep an open mind and you will be exposed to new concepts and ideas.\"\r\n\"This is book two in the series Witches and Warlocks. Vance and Portia's characters are maturing, traveling from their small town out of state and to exotic places, and new people are falling into the trap of Damien, Vance's evil father. They form new alliances and discover the secrets run deep and are sickly. I like that Portia is learning her self worth. She's getting a backbone and kicking back. Every time I thought the suspense was slowing down, it rose to new heights.\"\r\n\"The work in question is particularly appealing to physicians, as they have experienced what Dr. London is describing, having traveled the same road through college and medical school and private practice. His wit is keen and often it makes the reader laugh out loud . . . nearly unable to stop. Patients will also enjoy it, but the common understanding of physicians makes M.D.'s the real target of this book.\"\r\n\"My wife and I initially looked for a book to find 'off the beaten path' type places withing a few hours for weekend trips and stumbled upon this book. I doubt we'll travel all 50 states, but its sure fun to look at all the things that each state has to offer. Its laid out and informative enough to just have as a book to browse through even if you don't plan to travel with it. The only down side is that it covers so much territory that the destinations are often far apart, so you can't really plan a trip around it. Good supplement to get the ideas flowing though. Nice book and a real bargain!\"\r\n\"Name dropping, with just some adjectives here and there to make a text.8 pages on average for each Age/House/Dynasty, with a short sketch of the relationships between the different family members, before the author moves to the next chapter.I bought this book to discover the story of Scotland that I am ignorant about, but I won't make it with Tranter's book. Frankly, I found the History part of my travel guide more relevant and readable than this.Fortunately, the author do not bother us with the dates. The sole good point of this book.\"",

This is only to be expected - you can't really do a whole country in one short book.Overall the book is great for what it is - a broad overview of France.

  "input_docs": "\"This books is great in multiple ways. First of all, it presents all of the versions of the argument spoken about in the text in a way that will deepen one's understanding of the cosmological arguments that have been given by the great thinkers through history. Second, it will spark one's interest in researching the topic even further. Third, it is a great companion book to any philosophy of religion course that takes a look at the cosmological argument. As a student of philosophy, I give it two thumbs up.\"\r\n\"This is a real masterpiece, and a must-read for anyone interested in American history, trees, the environment, or simply looking for a page-turner. Rutkow manages to make the fascinating and unknown history come alive, to turn dense, rigorous research into enjoyable prose. Using trees as a lens to view American history was a groundbreaking and ambitious goal that was brilliantly executed. I'm ready for volume II!\"\r\n\"I am not crazy about the way this author writes, didn't like it in her first book either, it is a little too boring. But the content materials of her books are definitely worth reading, very refreshingly American--no nonsense, good hearted, resourceful, hard working people with wicked sense of humor, constantly adapting to challenges, constantly overcoming obstacles, improvising and inventing ways to utilize whatever resources available. These are no whiners! In my life where the sense of discontent often blinds me from seeing the bountiful reasons for gratitude, this book put me in place and I am grateful to the author for sharing the history of her grandmother.\"\r\n\"I love this book. With color photos, maps, and helpful descriptions of what to do, where to eat and stay, and how to get there, this guidebook is a pleasure to read. It gives suggestions for countless trips of one day to two weeks, detailing everything there is to see and do, how much time is required at each stop, and how to get to the next destination.The book can be a bit confusing, since one attraction may be listed in many places under different side trips, but reading the entire book page by page is a joy, at once both exhilarating and exhausting, as you daydream of seeing all the beauty, charm, and history Great Britain has to offer. Highly recommended.\"\r\n\"After thoroughly reading this book, I have to say that it achieves two important things. The first is that it breaks down the issue of fatalism in such a way that is easy to understand, and yet it does not sacrifice truth at the altar of understanding. The second thing that it achieves is that it explains both good and bad proposed solutions to the problem. To conclude, Bill Craig has done a masterful job of explicating the issue.If one is looking for another book written on this subject by the same author that is more technical and rigorous, see Craig's \"\"Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom\"\" in Brill's Studies in Intellectual History.\"\r\n\"This book displays history and mythology in a very unusual, yet good way. I really liked this book because it shows the religious and cultural value of India. This book was about Valkmiki and Hanuman's Ramayan. Valmiki wrote his version of Ramayan and asked other people how they liked it. They all enjoyed reading it. However, naarad said that he read a better version of Rayaman written by Hanuman. When Valmiki read this version of Ramayan, which was written on leaves, he started to cry. Hanuman took these banana leaves and ate them.I definitely love this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes historical books.\"\r\n\"I'm an investment advisor.I recommend this book to all laypeople who want to self-educate.In my opinion, this may be the best investing book for laypeople ever written.The first part was kind of thick, in my opinion (it is about history of investing and the risk/reward tradeoff). But if you slog through those first few dozen pages, you will be richly rewarded by the rest of the book.Only other books that come close to this book, in my opinion, for self-education of laypeople are:- Common Sense on Mutual Funds, by Bogle, and- A Random Walk Down Wall Street, by Malkiel\"\r\n\"I purchased this book because I had watched Professor Lerer's History of the English Language contribution to The Learning Company's Great Courses series of DVDs. The book did not disappoint; it is if anything even more informative and absorbing than was the DVD.I recommend [[ASIN:023113794X Inventing English: A Portable History of the Language]] to anyone interested in the many *whys* of our language. Because English has evolved (and is still evolving) from so many other languages, its history is especially intriguing.Seth Lerer writes English beautifully, and I believe you will be as delighted by this book as was I!\"\r\n\"Leave it to Hugh Hewitt to tell it like it is. This is the book I was looking for. I wanted to learn some real things about Romeny, and did not want to be bombarded with left wing poison. Its impossible to watch the news without getting the newscasters slant on Mitt, and scoffing about his religion, while ignoring Obama and his Muslim history. One has to look around to find something outside of the mainstream.\"\r\n\"If there is any doubt with regard to the true nature of Communism, this book will inform the reader as to just how evil it is. In the century it has been practiced, from the Soviet Union to Cuba, the slaughter has been hideous. Conservively 100 million people have been slaughtered. This book tells the real history of this vile creed. It is a complete reference manual to Communism and serious scholars should have it in their libraries.\"\r\n\"I thought the book was good, but a little confusing at times. For example when the chapter of Alexander and India it talks about the battle of Hydaspes River and then all of a sudden goes back to the start of the invasion and then talks about the battle again. I learned that Alexander was not only an amazing tactician, but also a kind man to some people. I would recommend this book to those who like ancient history and have enough time on their hands to read it. Yes I would say this book is \"\"Important\"\" for people who have been able to achieve so much should be remembered and this book goes into great detail of Alexander.\"\r\n\"This is an excellent picture book of the lovely chalet; I just wish it had some floor plan measurements; in my fifties now, I grew up with parents that never spoke about the war, no one did; Anyway, the colour pictures bring the building and it's history to life, and despite it's owner, it was a lovely building, with historical and tragic significance; I understand why it had to be destroyed, and why it can't be rebuilt, but it was a lovely building. Oh, and my book was sealed in plastic but missing the english translation, wish the publisher would post a download link.\"\r\n\"I had heard many good things about Guerber's histories and assumed that an updated and expanded history of the ancient Near East would be even better than the original. My mistake! Christine Miller rewrote Guerber's original to reflect her fundamentalist Protestant beliefs, including that Creation occurred in 4004 BC and that the patriarchs, starting with Adam, wrote down their own family history and handed the sacred books down from one generation to the next. The history of other societies in the Near East is changed to accommodate Miller's chronology. If you are looking for biblical history, stick with the original Guerber.\"\r\n\"Alan Moore is a fascinating subject for an interview. Not only are his works among the finest in comics history, unique in their depth, conviction and intellect, but Moore as a person is similarly one-of-a-kind. The interviews collected here present Moore on a range of subjects and span most of his career. The book is well worth the attention of anyone interested in Moore's work, or comics in general. A handy tome featuring some of Moore's finest interviews, this collection is a welcome addition to any Alan Moore library. Buy it.\"\r\n\"I highly recommend this book to any enthusiast, master and any belt rank who is learning this amazing martial arts, As I am! Very truthful, open and honest. No sugar coating here! Great insight to the history and making of Taekwondo as well as fulfilling the promise of the title of this book by relating ancient knowledge to the modern world we live in. It gives reader a 'bird's eye' view of everything associated it with in general. It goes over everything and I mean everything in a readable and understandable way! Really, it's so amazing I can not find the right words. Honestly, you just need to read it.\"\r\n\"I bought this gift for my sister-in-law because she is as dotty over Downton Abbey as I am. She said that it is a very \"\"lush\"\" book, and the pictures are exquisite. She said that you can make out the details of the costumes, and that it does give background information about the show and the history of its origins. Because it is a gift, I do not know how much detail it goes into about history, but I do know from the way my sister-in-law described the pictures, that she was pleased with all of the detail they picked up, especially the details in the costumes. I'm pleased that the gift pleased her. She's a very nice person.\"\r\n\"The Browns have written a fascinating book about their history and marital life. As a faithful viewer of the mesmerizing Sister Wives, I thought I knew their story but I did not. They have forged a family through financial hardship, tears, and buckets of blood under the bridge. \"\"The family is the test of freedom, because the family is the only thing that the free man makes for himself and by himself.\"\" -- C.K. Chesterton, 1919\"\r\n\"I don't know why our professor likes this book. It has nothing more than any other book on the US Government. That is to say that the basic history of American Government is pretty straightforward; we've only been around 200 years as a country. So the book has a lot of filler in it. The real zinger is the price. I paid $180 for this book at the campus bookstore. Amazon has it for around $160. The buyback here is $26 bucks! $26 bucks!Everything covered in this book is basic high school civics. The high price goes to pay the very high \"\"tax\"\" of going to college.\"\r\n\"I suppose the literature that satires Australia and the likes for Western readers is misunderstood; background in history and anthropology is a plus -- I mean reading Self isn't like applying body lotion to determine if one likes its smell, tackiness and synthesis...if you don't get Will maybe its an aquired taste. I think his SATIRE is tremendously funny and fun poking at all those humans who like to imagine they are better than ordinary humans.\"\r\n\"One should know that pages 2-29 are missing from this edition. These pages crucially cover the early life and conversion of Frances to the Catholic faith. I called Amazon and they sent me a replacement copy in 2 days. Unfortunately that copy was missing the same pages. It seems all books in this print run missed these pages. Look for another edition if you want St. Francis's early history. Otherwise this book contains all three \"\"lives\"\" of St. Francis and is compact and fairly easy to read, although later translations (year 2000 or so) are even easier to read.\"",

Because it is a gift, I do not know how much detail it goes into about history, but I do know from the way my sister-in-law described the pictures, that she was pleased with all of the detail they picked up, especially the details in the costumes.

  "input_docs": "\"How A Business Works was an excellent book to read as I began my first semester as a college student. Although my goal is to major in Business, I started my semester off with no idea of even the basic guidelines a Business undergrad should know. This book describes in detail every aspect dealing with business relations, and I enjoyed reading it. It felt great going to my additional business classes prepared and knowledgeable on the subject they were describing. Very well written, Professor Haeberle! I recommend this book to anyone and everyone who would like additional knowledge pertaining to business matters.\"\r\nThis is an inspirational and insightful book that is well written and contains some profound methods to improve your thinking and improve your life. The ideas and methods that Robbins suggests are not just theory but I can attest from personal experience that they really work as I have successfully used some of the concepts. Fried summarizes the best personal development strategies and combines it with brilliant business principles to help you become the entrepreneur of your own existence. I LOVED it.\r\n\"Easy read. A tale of burning and flying, acceptance and soaring. I applaud this book describing a successful businessman who decides to chuck it all in hopes of finding out the big WHY. An almost believable story that combines humanness with spirituality, ya know, super oneness and love. I appreciated the author's command of the written word. It is alerting us to become aware we are on a journey of light and love. It's about meditation and where it can lead us. A story built around seeking, Thank you Jacob for sharing this teaching with us.\"\r\nWhether just starting out with a new business or being a seasoned owner pregnancy will throw some curve balls. This book helps you navigate through business and pregnancy and how they relate to one another. Must read for women who own their own businesses and want/are starting a family.**Disclosure - I received a copy of this book for review purposes. However all opinions are my own. You can see the full review on Astheygrowup.com**\r\n\"I read a lot of motivational, business and self help books. This one is nothing like the others. There's a ton of great advice in this book, much of it is counter to conventional wisdom. I found it refreshing to read because the author is not afraid to say things that may be unpopular. My only real complaint is that it is such an easy book to read (feels like you are in the room listening to him speak)that you may end up flying through some of the great points without them registering fully. Read this one with a highlighter in hand.\"\r\n\"Ken Segall's book is a much better and easier read than Isaacson's work. Following the lead of its title, the book is easy to follow with many interesting anecdotes about Steve Jobs and his competitors while instructing us on the art of Simplicity. Somehow, that subject has become lost to the extent that many of us overlook it in our personal and business lives. Thanks for the interesting and well-written lesson, Ken.\"\r\n\"Berardinelli is a trial lawyer who took Allstate to court and won. This is the corrupt auto insurance industry laid bare. All of the major companies bought the McKinsey & Co. business model that ensures they pay out the least amount on claims in order to maximize profits and executive bonuses.Want to know which are the most corrupt of the corrupt? Just look at the companies who spend the most money on TV and radio advertising. How else can they afford to pay for it all?Sadly, this book is widely unknown but it is must-reading for anyone with car insurance or in the market to buy car insurance. Caveat emptor indeed.\"\r\n\"Love Works is timely. In our economic climate, leaders can assume that they need to choose between profit and people. Joel Manby's thesis--backed up by decades of successful leadership--is different. A business run on timeless principles of love, like patience and kindness and truthfulness, can improve its bottom line and its relationships at the same time. Simply put, love actually works. This will be a refreshing read for anyone who feels that in order to succeed they must be a different person at work from who they truly want to be.\"\r\nThis book finally details what life was like in the trenches in the War on Terror and the brave men and women involved in the fight. It also provides credible insight into the politics of the situation and how politicians manipulated truth for political gain and cover. It's saying something that a man like Rodriguez trained in the art of deception and lying is more credible than the former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Her blatant lies regarding her knowledge and approval of these events are chilling. We are lucky to have hero's like Rodriguez providing an inside look at what is a dangerous business.;\r\n\"This book should be required reading in High School. By the time we pass this mark most people have very bad money habits.Sensible, salient and sincere, Roland explains investing in a way that makes you feel you are sitting down having a cup of coffee with him. Debunking several common myths of investing he drives home the need to make it your business to invest correctly or find someone not only qualified - but also someone with character. This is a fabulous book and by implementing just a few of his suggestions I will be growing my portfolio substantially!\"\r\n\"I work for a Franchising company and I am also a Business school graduate and I found this graphic novel fun to read and also extremely informative. No teacher that I had in while I was in school ever gave me a text book that was as intriguing to read as this one! I was very interested when I heard that it was a graphic novel and albeit a bit skeptical, but once I started reading it I had to close my office door and keep reading it. I want to hand a copy to all the potential franchisees that come in our office!\"\r\n\"Mark Griffin has blended his experience in both the secular business and the Christian cultures to provide a guidebook for business leaders who aspire to bring an \"\"eternal perspective\"\" to their workplaces. Most books in this genre emphasize the \"\"Core Value\"\" approach, but the author has gone the next step to provide realistic and practical implementation tools to weave those values into the fabric of their businesses. I would highly recommend this very practical guidebook for business leaders or owners who wish to build their faith into their workplace.\"\r\n\"I bought this book because it was required for a class I was taking. It explains how to market a business on Google through Adwords (the Ads you see the side of a Google Search) and Ad placement (You can pay for your ad to be placed page one rather than page 20 of a Google Search). While the images in the book are helpful, everything in this book can be found by simply doing a Google search.SideBar: Running a Google ad campaign is VERY expensive. I would not recommend this type of marketing campaign for a small business, as it is easy to blow through $500 in a few weeks.\"\r\n\"If as a business leader, you care about things like ingenuity, innovation, and employees improvising creatively, you should read this book. I work in the healthcare profession and found myself nodding and agreeing vigorously with each point made. If only the senior most leaders at my company would read this! The best elements of Jugaad are 1) the flexibility of the concept, 2) the ability to tailor Jugaad to given products and initiatives, and 3) the fact that it brings some autonomy among employees and entrepreneurial spirit back into the workplace.\"\r\n\"I have utilized Fred's model to create an information marketing business that is now producing thousands of dollars per year. What you get with Fred is bare-bones, no-fluff useful information that you can immediately implement in your own business. This book is great because it provides an easy to follow step-by-step system on how to create, market and sell your information products.Buy this book if you are serious about improving your business!\"\r\n\"Every lawyer needs to generate business, so this book should be added to every lawyer's library. The sales principles in this book are universal and can be readily applied to the practice of law and the sales of legal services. In fact, the analytic approach to sales strategy revealed in this book should be especially appealing to lawyers, as we strive to provide unexpected value to our clients and expand our opportunities with both existing and future clients.\"\r\n\"I loved this book. It is told through the eyes of a young boy observing life in the streets and tenements of the Bronx, while trying to save his father from his fate. Rickie and his ancient, emotional grandmother run a bookie business from their tiny kitchen, and Ricky is condemned to stay home to answer the phone in case bets are called in. The characters are richly described and so real that you can recognize them. And yet they are also dreamlike and Dickensian in size - at times absurd and comical, and at other times dark and evil. A must on your summer reading list!\"\r\n\"As with many of the books I am working through, I am surprised I never read this one. It was short and enjoyable, full of interesting ideas. I am pretty sure however, that the cottage industry that adapts \"\"The Art of War\"\" to business, relationships, law, football, whatever else is full of crap. This book is about war and only an extreme bending of the author's words or cherry picking those words free of their context would make it apply elsewhere.Certainly not a science textbook, it has a few mistakes but I can see why the book continues to be read and studied after thousands of years. It was fun.\"\r\n\"There are many books on social media marketing still flooding the marketplace but this one rises above the rest. Shama lives and breathes social media and I know this because we both started blogging around the same time years back. She walks readers through understanding why social media is important and guides them from step to step explaining all the different ways you can make it work for your business. By reading this book, you'll be able to do more with less and stand out from the crowd.\"\r\n\"When I first purchased this book for class, I was surprised at how small it was in comparison to some of the other textbooks I had purchased for other business classes. But it shows that you don't have to have a huge book to learn about business. It is easy to read, understand and follow. It will be a great tool for anyone who is thinking about starting their own business or learning more about how businesses truly work.\"",

  "input_docs": "\"This books is great in multiple ways. First of all, it presents all of the versions of the argument spoken about in the text in a way that will deepen one's understanding of the cosmological arguments that have been given by the great thinkers through history. Second, it will spark one's interest in researching the topic even further. Third, it is a great companion book to any philosophy of religion course that takes a look at the cosmological argument. As a student of philosophy, I give it two thumbs up.\"\r\n\"This is a real masterpiece, and a must-read for anyone interested in American history, trees, the environment, or simply looking for a page-turner. Rutkow manages to make the fascinating and unknown history come alive, to turn dense, rigorous research into enjoyable prose. Using trees as a lens to view American history was a groundbreaking and ambitious goal that was brilliantly executed. I'm ready for volume II!\"\r\n\"I am not crazy about the way this author writes, didn't like it in her first book either, it is a little too boring. But the content materials of her books are definitely worth reading, very refreshingly American--no nonsense, good hearted, resourceful, hard working people with wicked sense of humor, constantly adapting to challenges, constantly overcoming obstacles, improvising and inventing ways to utilize whatever resources available. These are no whiners! In my life where the sense of discontent often blinds me from seeing the bountiful reasons for gratitude, this book put me in place and I am grateful to the author for sharing the history of her grandmother.\"\r\n\"I love this book. With color photos, maps, and helpful descriptions of what to do, where to eat and stay, and how to get there, this guidebook is a pleasure to read. It gives suggestions for countless trips of one day to two weeks, detailing everything there is to see and do, how much time is required at each stop, and how to get to the next destination.The book can be a bit confusing, since one attraction may be listed in many places under different side trips, but reading the entire book page by page is a joy, at once both exhilarating and exhausting, as you daydream of seeing all the beauty, charm, and history Great Britain has to offer. Highly recommended.\"\r\n\"After thoroughly reading this book, I have to say that it achieves two important things. The first is that it breaks down the issue of fatalism in such a way that is easy to understand, and yet it does not sacrifice truth at the altar of understanding. The second thing that it achieves is that it explains both good and bad proposed solutions to the problem. To conclude, Bill Craig has done a masterful job of explicating the issue.If one is looking for another book written on this subject by the same author that is more technical and rigorous, see Craig's \"\"Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom\"\" in Brill's Studies in Intellectual History.\"\r\n\"This book displays history and mythology in a very unusual, yet good way. I really liked this book because it shows the religious and cultural value of India. This book was about Valkmiki and Hanuman's Ramayan. Valmiki wrote his version of Ramayan and asked other people how they liked it. They all enjoyed reading it. However, naarad said that he read a better version of Rayaman written by Hanuman. When Valmiki read this version of Ramayan, which was written on leaves, he started to cry. Hanuman took these banana leaves and ate them.I definitely love this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes historical books.\"\r\n\"I'm an investment advisor.I recommend this book to all laypeople who want to self-educate.In my opinion, this may be the best investing book for laypeople ever written.The first part was kind of thick, in my opinion (it is about history of investing and the risk/reward tradeoff). But if you slog through those first few dozen pages, you will be richly rewarded by the rest of the book.Only other books that come close to this book, in my opinion, for self-education of laypeople are:- Common Sense on Mutual Funds, by Bogle, and- A Random Walk Down Wall Street, by Malkiel\"\r\n\"I purchased this book because I had watched Professor Lerer's History of the English Language contribution to The Learning Company's Great Courses series of DVDs. The book did not disappoint; it is if anything even more informative and absorbing than was the DVD.I recommend [[ASIN:023113794X Inventing English: A Portable History of the Language]] to anyone interested in the many *whys* of our language. Because English has evolved (and is still evolving) from so many other languages, its history is especially intriguing.Seth Lerer writes English beautifully, and I believe you will be as delighted by this book as was I!\"\r\n\"Leave it to Hugh Hewitt to tell it like it is. This is the book I was looking for. I wanted to learn some real things about Romeny, and did not want to be bombarded with left wing poison. Its impossible to watch the news without getting the newscasters slant on Mitt, and scoffing about his religion, while ignoring Obama and his Muslim history. One has to look around to find something outside of the mainstream.\"\r\n\"If there is any doubt with regard to the true nature of Communism, this book will inform the reader as to just how evil it is. In the century it has been practiced, from the Soviet Union to Cuba, the slaughter has been hideous. Conservively 100 million people have been slaughtered. This book tells the real history of this vile creed. It is a complete reference manual to Communism and serious scholars should have it in their libraries.\"\r\n\"I thought the book was good, but a little confusing at times. For example when the chapter of Alexander and India it talks about the battle of Hydaspes River and then all of a sudden goes back to the start of the invasion and then talks about the battle again. I learned that Alexander was not only an amazing tactician, but also a kind man to some people. I would recommend this book to those who like ancient history and have enough time on their hands to read it. Yes I would say this book is \"\"Important\"\" for people who have been able to achieve so much should be remembered and this book goes into great detail of Alexander.\"\r\n\"This is an excellent picture book of the lovely chalet; I just wish it had some floor plan measurements; in my fifties now, I grew up with parents that never spoke about the war, no one did; Anyway, the colour pictures bring the building and it's history to life, and despite it's owner, it was a lovely building, with historical and tragic significance; I understand why it had to be destroyed, and why it can't be rebuilt, but it was a lovely building. Oh, and my book was sealed in plastic but missing the english translation, wish the publisher would post a download link.\"\r\n\"I had heard many good things about Guerber's histories and assumed that an updated and expanded history of the ancient Near East would be even better than the original. My mistake! Christine Miller rewrote Guerber's original to reflect her fundamentalist Protestant beliefs, including that Creation occurred in 4004 BC and that the patriarchs, starting with Adam, wrote down their own family history and handed the sacred books down from one generation to the next. The history of other societies in the Near East is changed to accommodate Miller's chronology. If you are looking for biblical history, stick with the original Guerber.\"\r\n\"Alan Moore is a fascinating subject for an interview. Not only are his works among the finest in comics history, unique in their depth, conviction and intellect, but Moore as a person is similarly one-of-a-kind. The interviews collected here present Moore on a range of subjects and span most of his career. The book is well worth the attention of anyone interested in Moore's work, or comics in general. A handy tome featuring some of Moore's finest interviews, this collection is a welcome addition to any Alan Moore library. Buy it.\"\r\n\"I highly recommend this book to any enthusiast, master and any belt rank who is learning this amazing martial arts, As I am! Very truthful, open and honest. No sugar coating here! Great insight to the history and making of Taekwondo as well as fulfilling the promise of the title of this book by relating ancient knowledge to the modern world we live in. It gives reader a 'bird's eye' view of everything associated it with in general. It goes over everything and I mean everything in a readable and understandable way! Really, it's so amazing I can not find the right words. Honestly, you just need to read it.\"",

  "input_docs": "\"This books is great in multiple ways. First of all, it presents all of the versions of the argument spoken about in the text in a way that will deepen one's understanding of the cosmological arguments that have been given by the great thinkers through history. Second, it will spark one's interest in researching the topic even further. Third, it is a great companion book to any philosophy of religion course that takes a look at the cosmological argument. As a student of philosophy, I give it two thumbs up.\"\r\n\"This is a real masterpiece, and a must-read for anyone interested in American history, trees, the environment, or simply looking for a page-turner. Rutkow manages to make the fascinating and unknown history come alive, to turn dense, rigorous research into enjoyable prose. Using trees as a lens to view American history was a groundbreaking and ambitious goal that was brilliantly executed. I'm ready for volume II!\"\r\n\"I am not crazy about the way this author writes, didn't like it in her first book either, it is a little too boring. But the content materials of her books are definitely worth reading, very refreshingly American--no nonsense, good hearted, resourceful, hard working people with wicked sense of humor, constantly adapting to challenges, constantly overcoming obstacles, improvising and inventing ways to utilize whatever resources available. These are no whiners! In my life where the sense of discontent often blinds me from seeing the bountiful reasons for gratitude, this book put me in place and I am grateful to the author for sharing the history of her grandmother.\"\r\n\"I love this book. With color photos, maps, and helpful descriptions of what to do, where to eat and stay, and how to get there, this guidebook is a pleasure to read. It gives suggestions for countless trips of one day to two weeks, detailing everything there is to see and do, how much time is required at each stop, and how to get to the next destination.The book can be a bit confusing, since one attraction may be listed in many places under different side trips, but reading the entire book page by page is a joy, at once both exhilarating and exhausting, as you daydream of seeing all the beauty, charm, and history Great Britain has to offer. Highly recommended.\"\r\n\"After thoroughly reading this book, I have to say that it achieves two important things. The first is that it breaks down the issue of fatalism in such a way that is easy to understand, and yet it does not sacrifice truth at the altar of understanding. The second thing that it achieves is that it explains both good and bad proposed solutions to the problem. To conclude, Bill Craig has done a masterful job of explicating the issue.If one is looking for another book written on this subject by the same author that is more technical and rigorous, see Craig's \"\"Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom\"\" in Brill's Studies in Intellectual History.\"\r\n\"This book displays history and mythology in a very unusual, yet good way. I really liked this book because it shows the religious and cultural value of India. This book was about Valkmiki and Hanuman's Ramayan. Valmiki wrote his version of Ramayan and asked other people how they liked it. They all enjoyed reading it. However, naarad said that he read a better version of Rayaman written by Hanuman. When Valmiki read this version of Ramayan, which was written on leaves, he started to cry. Hanuman took these banana leaves and ate them.I definitely love this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes historical books.\"\r\n\"I'm an investment advisor.I recommend this book to all laypeople who want to self-educate.In my opinion, this may be the best investing book for laypeople ever written.The first part was kind of thick, in my opinion (it is about history of investing and the risk/reward tradeoff). But if you slog through those first few dozen pages, you will be richly rewarded by the rest of the book.Only other books that come close to this book, in my opinion, for self-education of laypeople are:- Common Sense on Mutual Funds, by Bogle, and- A Random Walk Down Wall Street, by Malkiel\"\r\n\"I purchased this book because I had watched Professor Lerer's History of the English Language contribution to The Learning Company's Great Courses series of DVDs. The book did not disappoint; it is if anything even more informative and absorbing than was the DVD.I recommend [[ASIN:023113794X Inventing English: A Portable History of the Language]] to anyone interested in the many *whys* of our language. Because English has evolved (and is still evolving) from so many other languages, its history is especially intriguing.Seth Lerer writes English beautifully, and I believe you will be as delighted by this book as was I!\"\r\n\"Leave it to Hugh Hewitt to tell it like it is. This is the book I was looking for. I wanted to learn some real things about Romeny, and did not want to be bombarded with left wing poison. Its impossible to watch the news without getting the newscasters slant on Mitt, and scoffing about his religion, while ignoring Obama and his Muslim history. One has to look around to find something outside of the mainstream.\"\r\n\"If there is any doubt with regard to the true nature of Communism, this book will inform the reader as to just how evil it is. In the century it has been practiced, from the Soviet Union to Cuba, the slaughter has been hideous. Conservively 100 million people have been slaughtered. This book tells the real history of this vile creed. It is a complete reference manual to Communism and serious scholars should have it in their libraries.\"\r\n\"I thought the book was good, but a little confusing at times. For example when the chapter of Alexander and India it talks about the battle of Hydaspes River and then all of a sudden goes back to the start of the invasion and then talks about the battle again. I learned that Alexander was not only an amazing tactician, but also a kind man to some people. I would recommend this book to those who like ancient history and have enough time on their hands to read it. Yes I would say this book is \"\"Important\"\" for people who have been able to achieve so much should be remembered and this book goes into great detail of Alexander.\"\r\n\"This is an excellent picture book of the lovely chalet; I just wish it had some floor plan measurements; in my fifties now, I grew up with parents that never spoke about the war, no one did; Anyway, the colour pictures bring the building and it's history to life, and despite it's owner, it was a lovely building, with historical and tragic significance; I understand why it had to be destroyed, and why it can't be rebuilt, but it was a lovely building. Oh, and my book was sealed in plastic but missing the english translation, wish the publisher would post a download link.\"\r\n\"I had heard many good things about Guerber's histories and assumed that an updated and expanded history of the ancient Near East would be even better than the original. My mistake! Christine Miller rewrote Guerber's original to reflect her fundamentalist Protestant beliefs, including that Creation occurred in 4004 BC and that the patriarchs, starting with Adam, wrote down their own family history and handed the sacred books down from one generation to the next. The history of other societies in the Near East is changed to accommodate Miller's chronology. If you are looking for biblical history, stick with the original Guerber.\"\r\n\"Alan Moore is a fascinating subject for an interview. Not only are his works among the finest in comics history, unique in their depth, conviction and intellect, but Moore as a person is similarly one-of-a-kind. The interviews collected here present Moore on a range of subjects and span most of his career. The book is well worth the attention of anyone interested in Moore's work, or comics in general. A handy tome featuring some of Moore's finest interviews, this collection is a welcome addition to any Alan Moore library. Buy it.\"\r\n\"I highly recommend this book to any enthusiast, master and any belt rank who is learning this amazing martial arts, As I am! Very truthful, open and honest. No sugar coating here! Great insight to the history and making of Taekwondo as well as fulfilling the promise of the title of this book by relating ancient knowledge to the modern world we live in. It gives reader a 'bird's eye' view of everything associated it with in general. It goes over everything and I mean everything in a readable and understandable way!

  "input_docs": "\"How A Business Works was an excellent book to read as I began my first semester as a college student. Although my goal is to major in Business, I started my semester off with no idea of even the basic guidelines a Business undergrad should know. This book describes in detail every aspect dealing with business relations, and I enjoyed reading it. It felt great going to my additional business classes prepared and knowledgeable on the subject they were describing. Very well written, Professor Haeberle! I recommend this book to anyone and everyone who would like additional knowledge pertaining to business matters.\"\r\nThis is an inspirational and insightful book that is well written and contains some profound methods to improve your thinking and improve your life. The ideas and methods that Robbins suggests are not just theory but I can attest from personal experience that they really work as I have successfully used some of the concepts. Fried summarizes the best personal development strategies and combines it with brilliant business principles to help you become the entrepreneur of your own existence. I LOVED it.\r\n\"Easy read. A tale of burning and flying, acceptance and soaring. I applaud this book describing a successful businessman who decides to chuck it all in hopes of finding out the big WHY. An almost believable story that combines humanness with spirituality, ya know, super oneness and love. I appreciated the author's command of the written word. It is alerting us to become aware we are on a journey of light and love. It's about meditation and where it can lead us. A story built around seeking, Thank you Jacob for sharing this teaching with us.\"\r\nWhether just starting out with a new business or being a seasoned owner pregnancy will throw some curve balls. This book helps you navigate through business and pregnancy and how they relate to one another. Must read for women who own their own businesses and want/are starting a family.**Disclosure - I received a copy of this book for review purposes. However all opinions are my own. You can see the full review on Astheygrowup.com**\r\n\"I read a lot of motivational, business and self help books. This one is nothing like the others. There's a ton of great advice in this book, much of it is counter to conventional wisdom. I found it refreshing to read because the author is not afraid to say things that may be unpopular. My only real complaint is that it is such an easy book to read (feels like you are in the room listening to him speak)that you may end up flying through some of the great points without them registering fully. Read this one with a highlighter in hand.\"\r\n\"Ken Segall's book is a much better and easier read than Isaacson's work. Following the lead of its title, the book is easy to follow with many interesting anecdotes about Steve Jobs and his competitors while instructing us on the art of Simplicity. Somehow, that subject has become lost to the extent that many of us overlook it in our personal and business lives. Thanks for the interesting and well-written lesson, Ken.\"\r\n\"Berardinelli is a trial lawyer who took Allstate to court and won. This is the corrupt auto insurance industry laid bare. All of the major companies bought the McKinsey & Co. business model that ensures they pay out the least amount on claims in order to maximize profits and executive bonuses.Want to know which are the most corrupt of the corrupt? Just look at the companies who spend the most money on TV and radio advertising. How else can they afford to pay for it all?Sadly, this book is widely unknown but it is must-reading for anyone with car insurance or in the market to buy car insurance. Caveat emptor indeed.\"\r\n\"Love Works is timely. In our economic climate, leaders can assume that they need to choose between profit and people. Joel Manby's thesis--backed up by decades of successful leadership--is different. A business run on timeless principles of love, like patience and kindness and truthfulness, can improve its bottom line and its relationships at the same time. Simply put, love actually works. This will be a refreshing read for anyone who feels that in order to succeed they must be a different person at work from who they truly want to be.\"\r\nThis book finally details what life was like in the trenches in the War on Terror and the brave men and women involved in the fight. It also provides credible insight into the politics of the situation and how politicians manipulated truth for political gain and cover. It's saying something that a man like Rodriguez trained in the art of deception and lying is more credible than the former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Her blatant lies regarding her knowledge and approval of these events are chilling. We are lucky to have hero's like Rodriguez providing an inside look at what is a dangerous business.;\r\n\"This book should be required reading in High School. By the time we pass this mark most people have very bad money habits.Sensible, salient and sincere, Roland explains investing in a way that makes you feel you are sitting down having a cup of coffee with him. Debunking several common myths of investing he drives home the need to make it your business to invest correctly or find someone not only qualified - but also someone with character. This is a fabulous book and by implementing just a few of his suggestions I will be growing my portfolio substantially!\"\r\n\"I work for a Franchising company and I am also a Business school graduate and I found this graphic novel fun to read and also extremely informative. No teacher that I had in while I was in school ever gave me a text book that was as intriguing to read as this one! I was very interested when I heard that it was a graphic novel and albeit a bit skeptical, but once I started reading it I had to close my office door and keep reading it. I want to hand a copy to all the potential franchisees that come in our office!\"\r\n\"Mark Griffin has blended his experience in both the secular business and the Christian cultures to provide a guidebook for business leaders who aspire to bring an \"\"eternal perspective\"\" to their workplaces. Most books in this genre emphasize the \"\"Core Value\"\" approach, but the author has gone the next step to provide realistic and practical implementation tools to weave those values into the fabric of their businesses. I would highly recommend this very practical guidebook for business leaders or owners who wish to build their faith into their workplace.\"\r\n\"I bought this book because it was required for a class I was taking. It explains how to market a business on Google through Adwords (the Ads you see the side of a Google Search) and Ad placement (You can pay for your ad to be placed page one rather than page 20 of a Google Search). While the images in the book are helpful, everything in this book can be found by simply doing a Google search.SideBar: Running a Google ad campaign is VERY expensive. I would not recommend this type of marketing campaign for a small business, as it is easy to blow through $500 in a few weeks.\"\r\n\"If as a business leader, you care about things like ingenuity, innovation, and employees improvising creatively, you should read this book. I work in the healthcare profession and found myself nodding and agreeing vigorously with each point made. If only the senior most leaders at my company would read this! The best elements of Jugaad are 1) the flexibility of the concept, 2) the ability to tailor Jugaad to given products and initiatives, and 3) the fact that it brings some autonomy among employees and entrepreneurial spirit back into the workplace.\"\r\n\"I have utilized Fred's model to create an information marketing business that is now producing thousands of dollars per year. What you get with Fred is bare-bones, no-fluff useful information that you can immediately implement in your own business. This book is great because it provides an easy to follow step-by-step system on how to create, market and sell your information products.Buy this book if you are serious about improving your business!\"",

Although my goal is to major in Business, I started my semester off with no idea of even the basic guidelines a Business undergrad should know. This book describes in detail every aspect dealing with business relations, and I enjoyed reading it. It felt great going to my additional business classes prepared and knowledgeable on the subject they were describing. Very well written, Professor Haeberle! I recommend this book to anyone and everyone who would like additional knowledge pertaining to business matters.\"\r\nThis is an inspirational and insightful book that is well written and contains some profound methods to improve your thinking and improve your life. The ideas and methods that Robbins suggests are not just theory but I can attest from personal experience that they really work as I have successfully used some of the concepts. Fried summarizes the best personal development strategies and combines it with brilliant business principles to help you become the entrepreneur of your own existence. I LOVED it.\r\n\"Easy read. A tale of burning and flying, acceptance and soaring. I applaud this book describing a successful businessman who decides to chuck it all in hopes of finding out the big WHY. An almost believable story that combines humanness with spirituality, ya know, super oneness and love. I appreciated the author's command of the written word. It is alerting us to become aware we are on a journey of light and love. It's about meditation and where it can lead us. A story built around seeking, Thank you Jacob for sharing this teaching with us.\"\r\nWhether just starting out with a new business or being a seasoned owner pregnancy will throw some curve balls. This book helps you navigate through business and pregnancy and how they relate to one another. Must read for women who own their own businesses and want/are starting a family.**Disclosure - I received a copy of this book for review purposes. However all opinions are my own. You can see the full review on Astheygrowup.com**\r\n\"I read a lot of motivational, business and self help books. This one is nothing like the others. There's a ton of great advice in this book, much of it is counter to conventional wisdom. I found it refreshing to read because the author is not afraid to say things that may be unpopular. My only real complaint is that it is such an easy book to read (feels like you are in the room listening to him speak)that you may end up flying through some of the great points without them registering fully. Read this one with a highlighter in hand.\"\r\n\"Ken Segall's book is a much better and easier read than Isaacson's work. Following the lead of its title, the book is easy to follow with many interesting anecdotes about Steve Jobs and his competitors while instructing us on the art of Simplicity. Somehow, that subject has become lost to the extent that many of us overlook it in our personal and business lives. Thanks for the interesting and well-written lesson, Ken.\"\r\n\"Berardinelli is a trial lawyer who took Allstate to court and won. This is the corrupt auto insurance industry laid bare. All of the major companies bought the McKinsey & Co. business model that ensures they pay out the least amount on claims in order to maximize profits and executive bonuses.Want to know which are the most corrupt of the corrupt? Just look at the companies who spend the most money on TV and radio advertising. How else can they afford to pay for it all?Sadly, this book is widely unknown but it is must-reading for anyone with car insurance or in the market to buy car insurance. Caveat emptor indeed.\"\r\n\"Love Works is timely. In our economic climate, leaders can assume that they need to choose between profit and people. Joel Manby's thesis--backed up by decades of successful leadership--is different. A business run on timeless principles of love, like patience and kindness and truthfulness, can improve its bottom line and its relationships at the same time. Simply put, love actually works. This will be a refreshing read for anyone who feels that in order to succeed they must be a different person at work from who they truly want to be.\"\r\nThis book finally details what life was like in the trenches in the War on Terror and the brave men and women involved in the fight. It also provides credible insight into the politics of the situation and how politicians manipulated truth for political gain and cover. It's saying something that a man like Rodriguez trained in the art of deception and lying is more credible than the former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Her blatant lies regarding her knowledge and approval of these events are chilling. We are lucky to have hero's like Rodriguez providing an inside look at what is a dangerous business.;\r\n\"This book should be required reading in High School. By the time we pass this mark most people have very bad money habits.Sensible, salient and sincere, Roland explains investing in a way that makes you feel you are sitting down having a cup of coffee with him. Debunking several common myths of investing he drives home the need to make it your business to invest correctly or find someone not only qualified - but also someone with character. This is a fabulous book and by implementing just a few of his suggestions I will be growing my portfolio substantially!\"\r\n\"I work for a Franchising company and I am also a Business school graduate and I found this graphic novel fun to read and also extremely informative. No teacher that I had in while I was in school ever gave me a text book that was as intriguing to read as this one! I was very interested when I heard that it was a graphic novel and albeit a bit skeptical, but once I started reading it I had to close my office door and keep reading it. I want to hand a copy to all the potential franchisees that come in our office!\"\r\n\"Mark Griffin has blended his experience in both the secular business and the Christian cultures to provide a guidebook for business leaders who aspire to bring an \"\"eternal perspective\"\" to their workplaces. Most books in this genre emphasize the \"\"Core Value\"\" approach, but the author has gone the next step to provide realistic and practical implementation tools to weave those values into the fabric of their businesses. I would highly recommend this very practical guidebook for business leaders or owners who wish to build their faith into their workplace.\"\r\n\"I bought this book because it was required for a class I was taking. It explains how to market a business on Google through Adwords (the Ads you see the side of a Google Search) and Ad placement (You can pay for your ad to be placed page one rather than page 20 of a Google Search). While the images in the book are helpful, everything in this book can be found by simply doing a Google search.SideBar: Running a Google ad campaign is VERY expensive. I would not recommend this type of marketing campaign for a small business, as it is easy to blow through $500 in a few weeks.\"\r\n\"If as a business leader, you care about things like ingenuity, innovation, and employees improvising creatively, you should read this book. I work in the healthcare profession and found myself nodding and agreeing vigorously with each point made. If only the senior most leaders at my company would read this! The best elements of Jugaad are 1) the flexibility of the concept, 2) the ability to tailor Jugaad to given products and initiatives, and 3) the fact that it brings some autonomy among employees and entrepreneurial spirit back into the workplace.\"\r\n\"I have utilized Fred's model to create an information marketing business that is now producing thousands of dollars per year. What you get with Fred is bare-bones, no-fluff useful information that you can immediately implement in your own business. This book is great because it provides an easy to follow step-by-step system on how to create, market and sell your information products.Buy this book if you are serious about improving your business!\"",

It felt great going to my additional business classes prepared and knowledgeable on the subject they were describing. Very well written, Professor Haeberle! I recommend this book to anyone and everyone who would like additional knowledge pertaining to business matters.\"\r\nThis is an inspirational and insightful book that is well written and contains some profound methods to improve your thinking and improve your life. The ideas and methods that Robbins suggests are not just theory but I can attest from personal experience that they really work as I have successfully used some of the concepts. Fried summarizes the best personal development strategies and combines it with brilliant business principles to help you become the entrepreneur of your own existence. I LOVED it.\r\n\"Easy read. A tale of burning and flying, acceptance and soaring. I applaud this book describing a successful businessman who decides to chuck it all in hopes of finding out the big WHY. An almost believable story that combines humanness with spirituality, ya know, super oneness and love. I appreciated the author's command of the written word. It is alerting us to become aware we are on a journey of light and love. It's about meditation and where it can lead us. A story built around seeking, Thank you Jacob for sharing this teaching with us.\"\r\nWhether just starting out with a new business or being a seasoned owner pregnancy will throw some curve balls. This book helps you navigate through business and pregnancy and how they relate to one another. Must read for women who own their own businesses and want/are starting a family.**Disclosure - I received a copy of this book for review purposes. However all opinions are my own. You can see the full review on Astheygrowup.com**\r\n\"I read a lot of motivational, business and self help books. This one is nothing like the others. There's a ton of great advice in this book, much of it is counter to conventional wisdom. I found it refreshing to read because the author is not afraid to say things that may be unpopular. My only real complaint is that it is such an easy book to read (feels like you are in the room listening to him speak)that you may end up flying through some of the great points without them registering fully. Read this one with a highlighter in hand.\"\r\n\"Ken Segall's book is a much better and easier read than Isaacson's work. Following the lead of its title, the book is easy to follow with many interesting anecdotes about Steve Jobs and his competitors while instructing us on the art of Simplicity. Somehow, that subject has become lost to the extent that many of us overlook it in our personal and business lives. Thanks for the interesting and well-written lesson, Ken.\"\r\n\"Berardinelli is a trial lawyer who took Allstate to court and won. This is the corrupt auto insurance industry laid bare. All of the major companies bought the McKinsey & Co. business model that ensures they pay out the least amount on claims in order to maximize profits and executive bonuses.Want to know which are the most corrupt of the corrupt? Just look at the companies who spend the most money on TV and radio advertising. How else can they afford to pay for it all?Sadly, this book is widely unknown but it is must-reading for anyone with car insurance or in the market to buy car insurance. Caveat emptor indeed.\"\r\n\"Love Works is timely. In our economic climate, leaders can assume that they need to choose between profit and people. Joel Manby's thesis--backed up by decades of successful leadership--is different. A business run on timeless principles of love, like patience and kindness and truthfulness, can improve its bottom line and its relationships at the same time. Simply put, love actually works. This will be a refreshing read for anyone who feels that in order to succeed they must be a different person at work from who they truly want to be.\"\r\nThis book finally details what life was like in the trenches in the War on Terror and the brave men and women involved in the fight. It also provides credible insight into the politics of the situation and how politicians manipulated truth for political gain and cover. It's saying something that a man like Rodriguez trained in the art of deception and lying is more credible than the former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Her blatant lies regarding her knowledge and approval of these events are chilling. We are lucky to have hero's like Rodriguez providing an inside look at what is a dangerous business.;\r\n\"This book should be required reading in High School. By the time we pass this mark most people have very bad money habits.Sensible, salient and sincere, Roland explains investing in a way that makes you feel you are sitting down having a cup of coffee with him. Debunking several common myths of investing he drives home the need to make it your business to invest correctly or find someone not only qualified - but also someone with character. This is a fabulous book and by implementing just a few of his suggestions I will be growing my portfolio substantially!\"\r\n\"I work for a Franchising company and I am also a Business school graduate and I found this graphic novel fun to read and also extremely informative. No teacher that I had in while I was in school ever gave me a text book that was as intriguing to read as this one! I was very interested when I heard that it was a graphic novel and albeit a bit skeptical, but once I started reading it I had to close my office door and keep reading it. I want to hand a copy to all the potential franchisees that come in our office!\"\r\n\"Mark Griffin has blended his experience in both the secular business and the Christian cultures to provide a guidebook for business leaders who aspire to bring an \"\"eternal perspective\"\" to their workplaces. Most books in this genre emphasize the \"\"Core Value\"\" approach, but the author has gone the next step to provide realistic and practical implementation tools to weave those values into the fabric of their businesses. I would highly recommend this very practical guidebook for business leaders or owners who wish to build their faith into their workplace.\"\r\n\"I bought this book because it was required for a class I was taking. It explains how to market a business on Google through Adwords (the Ads you see the side of a Google Search) and Ad placement (You can pay for your ad to be placed page one rather than page 20 of a Google Search). While the images in the book are helpful, everything in this book can be found by simply doing a Google search.SideBar: Running a Google ad campaign is VERY expensive. I would not recommend this type of marketing campaign for a small business, as it is easy to blow through $500 in a few weeks.\"\r\n\"If as a business leader, you care about things like ingenuity, innovation, and employees improvising creatively, you should read this book. I work in the healthcare profession and found myself nodding and agreeing vigorously with each point made. If only the senior most leaders at my company would read this! The best elements of Jugaad are 1) the flexibility of the concept, 2) the ability to tailor Jugaad to given products and initiatives, and 3) the fact that it brings some autonomy among employees and entrepreneurial spirit back into the workplace.\"\r\n\"I have utilized Fred's model to create an information marketing business that is now producing thousands of dollars per year. What you get with Fred is bare-bones, no-fluff useful information that you can immediately implement in your own business. This book is great because it provides an easy to follow step-by-step system on how to create, market and sell your information products.Buy this book if you are serious about improving your business!\"",

  "input_docs": "\"This books is great in multiple ways. First of all, it presents all of the versions of the argument spoken about in the text in a way that will deepen one's understanding of the cosmological arguments that have been given by the great thinkers through history. Second, it will spark one's interest in researching the topic even further. Third, it is a great companion book to any philosophy of religion course that takes a look at the cosmological argument. As a student of philosophy, I give it two thumbs up.\"\r\n\"This is a real masterpiece, and a must-read for anyone interested in American history, trees, the environment, or simply looking for a page-turner. Rutkow manages to make the fascinating and unknown history come alive, to turn dense, rigorous research into enjoyable prose. Using trees as a lens to view American history was a groundbreaking and ambitious goal that was brilliantly executed. I'm ready for volume II!\"\r\n\"I am not crazy about the way this author writes, didn't like it in her first book either, it is a little too boring. But the content materials of her books are definitely worth reading, very refreshingly American--no nonsense, good hearted, resourceful, hard working people with wicked sense of humor, constantly adapting to challenges, constantly overcoming obstacles, improvising and inventing ways to utilize whatever resources available. These are no whiners! In my life where the sense of discontent often blinds me from seeing the bountiful reasons for gratitude, this book put me in place and I am grateful to the author for sharing the history of her grandmother.\"\r\n\"I love this book. With color photos, maps, and helpful descriptions of what to do, where to eat and stay, and how to get there, this guidebook is a pleasure to read. It gives suggestions for countless trips of one day to two weeks, detailing everything there is to see and do, how much time is required at each stop, and how to get to the next destination.The book can be a bit confusing, since one attraction may be listed in many places under different side trips, but reading the entire book page by page is a joy, at once both exhilarating and exhausting, as you daydream of seeing all the beauty, charm, and history Great Britain has to offer. Highly recommended.\"\r\n\"After thoroughly reading this book, I have to say that it achieves two important things. The first is that it breaks down the issue of fatalism in such a way that is easy to understand, and yet it does not sacrifice truth at the altar of understanding. The second thing that it achieves is that it explains both good and bad proposed solutions to the problem. To conclude, Bill Craig has done a masterful job of explicating the issue.If one is looking for another book written on this subject by the same author that is more technical and rigorous, see Craig's \"\"Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom\"\" in Brill's Studies in Intellectual History.\"\r\n\"This book displays history and mythology in a very unusual, yet good way. I really liked this book because it shows the religious and cultural value of India. This book was about Valkmiki and Hanuman's Ramayan. Valmiki wrote his version of Ramayan and asked other people how they liked it. They all enjoyed reading it. However, naarad said that he read a better version of Rayaman written by Hanuman. When Valmiki read this version of Ramayan, which was written on leaves, he started to cry. Hanuman took these banana leaves and ate them.I definitely love this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes historical books.\"\r\n\"I'm an investment advisor.I recommend this book to all laypeople who want to self-educate.In my opinion, this may be the best investing book for laypeople ever written.The first part was kind of thick, in my opinion (it is about history of investing and the risk/reward tradeoff). But if you slog through those first few dozen pages, you will be richly rewarded by the rest of the book.Only other books that come close to this book, in my opinion, for self-education of laypeople are:- Common Sense on Mutual Funds, by Bogle, and- A Random Walk Down Wall Street, by Malkiel\"\r\n\"I purchased this book because I had watched Professor Lerer's History of the English Language contribution to The Learning Company's Great Courses series of DVDs. The book did not disappoint; it is if anything even more informative and absorbing than was the DVD.I recommend [[ASIN:023113794X Inventing English: A Portable History of the Language]] to anyone interested in the many *whys* of our language. Because English has evolved (and is still evolving) from so many other languages, its history is especially intriguing.Seth Lerer writes English beautifully, and I believe you will be as delighted by this book as was I!\"\r\n\"Leave it to Hugh Hewitt to tell it like it is. This is the book I was looking for. I wanted to learn some real things about Romeny, and did not want to be bombarded with left wing poison. Its impossible to watch the news without getting the newscasters slant on Mitt, and scoffing about his religion, while ignoring Obama and his Muslim history. One has to look around to find something outside of the mainstream.\"\r\n\"If there is any doubt with regard to the true nature of Communism, this book will inform the reader as to just how evil it is. In the century it has been practiced, from the Soviet Union to Cuba, the slaughter has been hideous. Conservively 100 million people have been slaughtered. This book tells the real history of this vile creed. It is a complete reference manual to Communism and serious scholars should have it in their libraries.\"\r\n\"I thought the book was good, but a little confusing at times. For example when the chapter of Alexander and India it talks about the battle of Hydaspes River and then all of a sudden goes back to the start of the invasion and then talks about the battle again. I learned that Alexander was not only an amazing tactician, but also a kind man to some people. I would recommend this book to those who like ancient history and have enough time on their hands to read it. Yes I would say this book is \"\"Important\"\" for people who have been able to achieve so much should be remembered and this book goes into great detail of Alexander.\"\r\n\"This is an excellent picture book of the lovely chalet; I just wish it had some floor plan measurements; in my fifties now, I grew up with parents that never spoke about the war, no one did; Anyway, the colour pictures bring the building and it's history to life, and despite it's owner, it was a lovely building, with historical and tragic significance; I understand why it had to be destroyed, and why it can't be rebuilt, but it was a lovely building. Oh, and my book was sealed in plastic but missing the english translation, wish the publisher would post a download link.\"\r\n\"I had heard many good things about Guerber's histories and assumed that an updated and expanded history of the ancient Near East would be even better than the original. My mistake! Christine Miller rewrote Guerber's original to reflect her fundamentalist Protestant beliefs, including that Creation occurred in 4004 BC and that the patriarchs, starting with Adam, wrote down their own family history and handed the sacred books down from one generation to the next. The history of other societies in the Near East is changed to accommodate Miller's chronology. If you are looking for biblical history, stick with the original Guerber.\"\r\n\"Alan Moore is a fascinating subject for an interview. Not only are his works among the finest in comics history, unique in their depth, conviction and intellect, but Moore as a person is similarly one-of-a-kind. The interviews collected here present Moore on a range of subjects and span most of his career. The book is well worth the attention of anyone interested in Moore's work, or comics in general. A handy tome featuring some of Moore's finest interviews, this collection is a welcome addition to any Alan Moore library. Buy it.\"\r\n\"I highly recommend this book to any enthusiast, master and any belt rank who is learning this amazing martial arts, As I am! Very truthful, open and honest. No sugar coating here! Great insight to the history and making of Taekwondo as well as fulfilling the promise of the title of this book by relating ancient knowledge to the modern world we live in. It gives reader a 'bird's eye' view of everything associated it with in general. It goes over everything and I mean everything in a readable and understandable way! Really, it's so amazing I can not find the right words. Honestly, you just need to read it.\"",

But if you slog through those first few dozen pages, you will be richly rewarded by the rest of the book.Only other books that come close to this book, in my opinion, for self-education of laypeople are:- Common Sense on Mutual Funds, by Bogle, and- A Random Walk Down Wall Street, by Malkiel",

  "input_docs": "If you decide to eat here, just be aware it is going to take about 2 hours from beginning to end. We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience. \n\nThe food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.\n\n\n\n\nI've taken a lot of spin classes over the years, and nothing compares to the classes at Body Cycle. From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.\n\nFor anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).\n\nThere is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!\n\n\n\n\nFamily diner. Had the buffet. Eclectic assortment: a large chicken leg, fried jalapeño, tamale, two rolled grape leaves, fresh melon. All good. Lots of Mexican choices there. Also has a menu with breakfast served all day long. Friendly, attentive staff. Good place for a casual relaxed meal with no expectations. Next to the Clarion Hotel.\n\n\n\n\nWow!  Yummy, different,  delicious.   Our favorite is the lamb curry and korma.  With 10 different kinds of naan!!!  Don't let the outside deter you (because we almost changed our minds)...go in and try something new!   You'll be glad you did!\n\n\n\n\nCute interior and owner (?) gave us tour of upcoming patio/rooftop area which will be great on beautiful days like today. Cheese curds were very good and very filling. Really like that sandwiches come w salad, esp after eating too many curds! Had the onion, gruyere, tomato sandwich. Wasn't too much cheese which I liked. Needed something else...pepper jelly maybe. Would like to see more menu options added such as salads w fun cheeses. Lots of beer and wine as well as limited cocktails. Next time I will try one of the draft wines.\n\n\n\n\nI am a long term frequent customer of this establishment. I just went in to order take out (3 apps) and was told they're too busy to do it. Really? The place is maybe half full at best. Does your dick reach your ass? Yes? Go fuck yourself! I'm a frequent customer AND great tipper. Glad that Kanella just opened. NEVER going back to dmitris!\n\n\n\n\nLoved this tour! I grabbed a groupon and the price was great. It was the perfect way to explore New Orleans for someone who'd never been there before and didn't know a lot about the history of the city. Our tour guide had tons of interesting tidbits about the city, and I really enjoyed the experience. Highly recommended tour. I actually thought we were just going to tour through the cemetery, but she took us around the French Quarter for the first hour, and the cemetery for the second half of the tour. You'll meet up in front of a grocery store (seems strange at first, but it's not terribly hard to find, and it'll give you a chance to get some water), and you'll stop at a visitor center part way through the tour for a bathroom break if needed. This tour was one of my favorite parts of my trip!\n\n\n\n\nAmazingly amazing wings and homemade bleu cheese. Had the ribeye: tender, perfectly prepared, delicious. Nice selection of craft beers. Would DEFINITELY recommend checking out this hidden gem.\n\n\n\n\nThis easter instead of going to Lopez Lake we went to Los Padres National Forest which is really pretty but if you go to white rock the staff needs to cut down all the dead grass that invades the rock and the water. I would wish the staff would also clean or get rid of the dead grass that's also living by the water. The water is really green and dirty. Los padres national forest staff need to work hard to maintain this forest looking pretty and not like a dumpster. Even Cachuma lake looks like they put a bit more effort.\n\n\n\n\nHad a party of 6 here for hibachi. Our waitress brought our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn't really tell who's was who's and forgot several items on an order. I understand making mistakes but the restaraunt was really quiet so we were kind of surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our  cook  said maybe three words, but he cooked very well his name was Francisco. Service was fishy, food was pretty good, and im hoping it was just an off night here. But for the money I wouldn't go back.\n\n\n\n\nMy experience with Shalimar was nothing but wonderful. \nI wanted to get my engagement ring sized and was told over the phone that it could probably be done within the day. \nWhen I brought it by, the team confirmed that the jeweler would be able to accommodate my same-day request and that it would be around $40 (simple band, decrease by three full sizes).\nI checked my size one more time, confirmed, and left to let them do their thing.\nWhen I came to pick up later that afternoon, the ring was too small. It's very important to note that Shalimar sized the ring perfectly, but that I made a mistake and should've gone up a half-size.\nThe Shalimar group were completely understanding and accommodating, even resizing my ring back up and getting it back to me within an hour at no charge! Even though it was my mistake!\nThe associates' attitudes in dealing with what was a pretty embarrassing situation instantly earned my satisfaction and loyalty as a customer. Very grateful for such a wonderful experience.\n\n\n\n\nLocals recommended Milktooth, and it's an amazing jewel of Indianapolis. I'm glade I had the chance to experience this.\n\n\n\n\nLove going here for happy hour or dinner!  Great patio with fans to beat the StL heat!   Also...very accomodating at this location.  I like the Veal Milanese but with mixed greens instead of pasta!  they'll modify the menu to suit your taste!\n\n\n\n\nGood food--loved the gnocchi with marinara\nthe baked eggplant appetizer was very good too\n\nThe service was very slow, but despite this, I'd go back, the food is just that good\n\n\n\n\nThe bun makes the Sonoran Dog. It's like a snuggie for the pup. A first, it seems ridiculous and almost like it's going to be too much, exactly like everyone's favorite blanket with sleeves. Too much softness, too much smush, too indulgent.  Wrong. It's warm, soft, chewy, fragrant, and it succeeds where other famed Sonoran Dogs fail. \n\nThe hot dog itself is flavorful, but I would prefer that it or the bacon have a little more bite or snap to better hold their own against the dominant mustard and onions. \n\nI'm with the masses on the carne asada caramelo. Excellent tortilla, salty, melty cheese, and great carne. \n\nSuper cheap and you can drive through.\n\n\n\n\nGreat place for breakfast! I had the waffle, which was fluffy and perfect, and home fries which were nice and smashed and crunchy. Friendly waitstaff. Will definitely be back!\n\n\n\n\nTremendous service (Big shout out to Douglas) that complemented the delicious food. Pretty expensive establishment (40-50$ avg for your main course), but its definitely backs that up with an atmosphere that's comparable with any of the top tier restaurants across the country.\n\n\n\n\nThe hubby and I have been here on multiple occasions and we have loved every part of the meal, every single time. Everyone from the servers to the bartender is very knowledgable about the menu and was able to immediately recommend items I could eat as-is, substitute or delete to make something safe for this Celiac girl to eat. The wine and cocktail menus are spot on. The food divine.  My only wish is that they would have a gluten-free dessert, we've always had to go elsewhere for something sweet. But that is not a big deal and I still want to go here time and time again.\n\n\n\n\nI go to blow bar to get my brows done by natalie (brow specialist) which i highly recommend she is great does a great job on my eyebrows! But then i got a blow by victoria!! Wow i was impress i have thin, straight, dead hair and she left me with the biggest volume ive ever had!!! Tried another girl but didnt like it as much so victoria will be my girl for ever; very beautiful clean place!!!\n\n\n\n\nMy absolute favorite cafe in the city. Their black and white latte is probably the best I've ever had (not too sweet and just the right amount of foam), soups are always really good (even for non-soup people) and there's just a lot of space to do work. The noise level is perfect, the music is at a perfect level, and I always enjoy when patrons bring their dogs. I'll keep giving them my business for as long as I can.\n\n\n\n\nHOLY SMOKES!\n\nactual pumpkin pie mixed in with the frozen custard......are you kidding me? Why hasn't this become a huge sweep the nation treat. \n\nThe best part was the chunks of pie crust. Like finding a diamond inside another diamond. Super yummy.\n\n\n\n\nUpland is a brewery based out of Bloomington, Indiana that has become popular enough to open up a couple additional locations in central Indiana.  All of their beers are very good, and I am also a fan of their burgers and tenderloins.  Therefore, I was excited to try their pizza, but I don't think it ended up being on par with these other items.  My margherita pizza had a cracker-like crust and was pretty light overall.  The cheese was good, but none of the other toppings added much flavor.  There was no red sauce as is typical for a true margherita pizza.  My opinion is that Upland's pizza might serve as a nice appetizer for a group, but I'll be sticking with their burgers or tenderloins as my meal of choice on future visits.\n\n\n\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the show.  Chill way to spend a Friday night.\n\n\n\n\nYes, this is the only sushi place in town. However, it is great when you're craving sushi and don't have time to go somewhere else. The salmon is probably the best fish they have, so we always order salmon. We also love their spicy edamame, tempura, ocean salad, and cabbage salad. Service has always been friendly and quick!\n\n\n\n\nI was really between 3 and 4 stars for this one. I LOVE the 96th street Naked Tchopstix so I was very excited to see this one which is closer to my house.\nThe vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it.\nMy daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry and it was quite yummy. Next time I am going to try the vanilla chai.\n\n\n\n\nWent for lunch. Beef brisket sandwich was awesome.   So juicy and tender.    Pulled pork was was just as good!\n\n\n\n\nBest thai food in the area.  Everything was authentic and delicious.  Will definitely be back again and again.\n\n\n\n\nService was crappy, and food was mediocre.  I wish I would have picked some other place for my last dinner in town.\n\n\n\n\nI recently had dinner here with my wife over the weekend and could not have been more pleased! \n\nOur meal was excellent! My wife and I were astounded by how quickly our food came out! Everything tasted fresh and homemade which we both appreciated. \n\nThe only problem was trying to pick something from the menu as there were too many delicious sounding items to choose from. We will definitely be returning to try more items! Can't wait to see what the next chef specials will be!\n\n\n\n\nI at least have to give this restaurant two stars due to the decent food. But while on a dinner meeting and after spending $100 on entrées and appetizers, I had to flag down the assistant cook, (the guy in bright red baggy pants watching TV), to see if I could get more avocado for my tuna entrée.  He made it very apparent and direct that he could not help me with that situation and I would have to flag down my  waitress so she could bill me for the four dollar avocado.\n\n\n\n\nFirst time there and it was excellent!!! It feels like your are entering someone's home. The waiters there funny and nice. The food come out very quickly and it is phenomenal!!! Definitely will be going back to this place.\n\n\n\n\nGreat burgers,fries and salad!  Burgers have a hint of salt and pepper flavor.\n\nThis location is very quaint. They only have outdoor seating\n\nFriendly staff.\n\nStreet parking as well as parking lot in the back.\n\n\n\n\nGreat staff always helps and always nice. Always clean and huge store size. Stays stocked with everything you need. The staff always helps make my custom breakfast bagel\n\n\n\n\nTook my vehicle here for some work a few years ago for a manufacturer recall. Problem went away and then started hearing another noise which I thought was related, but turned out was a completely different issue. Kevin and his mechanic lifted my car right up and fixed the issue FREE OF CHARGE even though I told them I'd pay. Outstanding individuals for doing that. Highly recommend!\n\n\n\n\nAfter my ROTD  yesterday of a different Sweet CeCe's location, I realized that I had never reviewed my local source!  Anyway, I love the product.  Love love love.  And I usually like their selection of toppings - good mix between healthy and not-so-healthy.  Sometimes the girls working there aren't really paying attention or are nowhere to be found.  Sometimes you have to remind them of their deals (like $5 Friday).  But I can't give it less than 4 stars because I just love it so much.\n\n\n\n\nWhat a great addition to the Funk Zone!  Grab a bite, grab some tastings, life is good. Right next door to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective, in fact it actually shares the same tables.  We had a fabulous savory croissant.\n\n\n\n\nNice relaxing place to get a massage! Same day appointments are easy to come by! I have never been disappointed with any therapist I have had at the Center!\n\n\n\n\nWe checked in around 2:30 pm.  Check-in was quick and easy with complimentary valet parking (always appreciated).  The Peppermill is huge and reminded us of the Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.  They have around eight restaurants on site offering almost any type of food you could want.  The casino area is huge, rivaling almost anything you could find in Las Vegas.  One thing we noticed is that many of the slot machines were noted as being penny machines, but when you actually started to play them you realized they had minimum bets of anywhere from 30 cents to $5.  Talk about false advertising!  We were in the Tuscany Tower on the 12th floor.  Our room had a nice view of the huge pool area.  Our room was large and featured free WiFi (likewise always appreciated), a huge bathroom area with large shower (with two shower heads), TV, a large jetted bathtub and a phone next to the commode.  There were dual sinks and lots of counter space.  Plenty of towels were supplied.  The roomy main area had a king bed with night stands, closet, TV, mini fridge, dresser with two drawers, a safe, table for computer or writing, complimentary bottles of water, and three nicely upholstered chairs and table.  The thermostat did a good job controlling the temperature and keeping it comfortable.  Staff were all courteous and helpful.  A very nice place and we enjoyed our stay.\n\n\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I tried this deli for the first time today. I had a turkey, avocado & bacon panini and he ha a buffalo chicken wrap. We will definitely be returning. The wait for food wasn't too long, which is always appreciated during lunch hour. There was SO much to choose from. They have salads, soup, macaroni, sandwiches and hot food. I love a deli that has many options to choose from!\n\n\n\n\nAmazing biscuits and (fill in the blank). Great cocktails too. Highly recommended. A bit busy though.\n\n\n\n\nFood was good- atmosphere/decor is like a fishing lodge- menu is someplace between outback & bonefish. Went on a Groupon & all 3 of our meals & calamari appetizer that we ordered were cooked perfectly- we will def be back.\n\n\n\n\nStraight to the point, it's cheap, it tastes and feels cheap\n\nThe good: price, location, dessert (edible food items are: baked chicken, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, Salad bar lol, meat and cheese bar, ravioli, pizza) also our waitress was bomb af\n\nThe meh: behind counter meat slicing station, shrimp (not even deveined), Mexican station\n\nThe bad: breakfast -worst eggs ever, actually worst, eggs. Le Benedict can't even cut through ham or English muffin (tried on all 3 occasions), steak, shrimp again, hell breaded items can't even, don't even. Decor it's the 1970 nightmare you can imagine\n\nTried 3 times and failed\n\n\n\n\nThe only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating, is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn't be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. \n\nAlthough that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \"last nights waiter\" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. \nI also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.\n\n\n\n\nStopped by after a Sunday morning walk in the park - great food, coffee customer service - love the vibe in here\n\n\n\n\nIn a word... \"OVERRATED!\".  The food took forever to come out.  The burger was WAY overcooked (Especially when I ordered it Medium Rare) and the Seafood Jumbalaya was Decent.  Not worth the price.  There are better places to eat in the french quarter.  It was not horrible, but for everything that we had heard about this place, I would have expected much better.\n\n\n\n\nComfortable bed, good breakfast, fast internet, great location, and low price. Overall I was really impressed with this place. However, if you stay on the top floors you may be waiting up to 15 minutes for an elevator in the morning.\n\n\n\n\nNEVER AGAIN. This is a so called restaurant that does nothing that a restaurant should other than prepare food, because the rest is done by the patron. Want water? Get up and go across the yard to get it. Want a drink, walk up a flight of stairs and pay cash. Want to sit in a dirty yard in dirty lawn chairs, enjoy yourself. The wait staff is mildy helpful in that they bring you your food after you go to the window and pay cash for it...kind of like New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but dirty and with live music (which is nice). It's a one in a lifetime experience for me...just once.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to pay for everything a la carte this is the place for you.  \nFood wasn't terrible not impressive.\nThey brought a basket of chips and some tomato sauce which I asked politely for something spicier and some pico de gallo.  She brought them happily to me and the salsa was much better.  When asked what we would like to drink I asked for a coke and she brought out a bottle which I stated I wanted the fountain drink.  She said \"oh that's only Pepsi\".  Never mentioned that they only had bottle drinks for coke.  \nWe ordered our food which was reasonably priced, asked for sour cream and also to put cheese on the taco.  She let us know cheese was extra.  \nIt was $2.50 extra for another basket of chips.  \nWhen I received the bill we paid more for the condiments then the actual food.  Side of sour cream 2.00, pico de gallo 2.50, salsa 2.00, chips 2.50, cheese 1.00 and the bottled coke that we didn't want 5.00.  \nJust a suggestion...when you order anything make sure to ask if there is an extra charge.\n\n\n\n\nThe cafe was extremely cute. We came at 8am and they even had a jazz band playing at that time. I got the breakfast sandwich and it was delicious. I loved how they rolled the egg and put the bacon pieces inside. Great price for a filling breakfast!\n\n\n\n\nOn a scale of one to things that are awesome, this place is the bomb. \n\nI was drawn in by the promise of the duckfat frenchfries. Took the boy for his birthday and put our name in, had a drink around the corner while we waited and were given seats at the bar after about 45 minutes. \n\nWe were waited on by Keith, the bartender, who was congenial, knowledgeable about his whiskeys and an all-around cool guy. We started with 3 cape may salts (two for me, one for the boy) and tater tots, both of which made me happy.\n\nFor dinner, I got Kentucky Fried Quail (stellar, though the succotash was not as exciting as I wanted it to be) and the boy got the 24$ Fois Gras burger, which was incredible. Worth every penny. The duckfat fries were pretty yummy, but not even the best part of the meal. I could've done without the cheese sauce, but as it was on the side I wasn't deterred.\n\nI look forward to coming back here, with everyone I know.\n\n\n\n\nWe started with the artichoke dip, big mistake. It was cold and the chips were stale. Mentioned to our waitress, but nothing came of it.  We ordered a large pizza, thin crust which after adding toppings it was a bit pricey for pizza.  Pizza was ok, not great. Except for not being our advocate our server was good.  I have been here before for Cardinals game, it was better then. Will try another venue next time.\n\n\n\n\nIt was my fiance's birthday and he decided he wanted a good, laid back Thai restaurant for dinner. Yelp steered us in the Jasmine Rice direction, and it was definitely a good decision. We wanted the summer rolls, which were on the menu, but apparently will not be available until summer, so we settled on the pan-fried dumplings. The flavor was good, but I don't think we'd order them again. We got the green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai. Both of those dishes were great, but the duck stole the show. That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late). Another person who got take-out was missing one of their items (but the owner realized it and called him and walked the dish to his house, which was very nice). Overall, good quality Thai! We would definitely go back.\n\n\n\n\nI absolutely love Courtney! She is hands down the best hairstylist I have ever had. The reason I think she is so great is that she knows what will look best on me and over the past year has understood my limits for styles. I always go into the salon and tell her to cut my hair how she thinks will look best, and I always leave blown away at what she does. You know you have a great stylist when you don't have to specify what you want done, but instead they see what needs to be done. Great stylist, great personality and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend her to anyone who wants to look their best.\n\n\n\n\nI've been to this location many times when I lived in the area and although it is a chain and not exactly sexy, it does the job on many occasions.   If you need an oil change, this place is ok, if you need a state inspection this place does it.   The key is getting there when they are not busy or else you will wait.   \n\nAgain, nothing fancy here a pep boys is a pep boys but all in all decent stuff.\n\n\n\n\nReplaced 2 old 70s lennox with 2 new ones.  They did a great job and have been runnong for 3 years now.\n\n\n\n\nI love the Brewpub for their variety of dishes.  Nachos, pizza and sandwiches.  Variety of beers to choose from crafted right on sight.  \n\nEvery time we go, the service is slow.  I think it's just the pace of the restaurant.  It's never a quick beer and a bite of food.  Instead, enjoy the patio and friends, savor that time.  \n\nKid and dog friendly environment.  Also great for your vegetarian and vegan friends.  \n\nMy go to is a half order of the nachos or fish & chips.  \n\nTried their Pumpkin Seasonal Beer and it's on par with some of my favorite pumpkins.\n\n\n\n\nFarmhouse, rustic, chic.Helpful staff with great ideas to decorate your home. Prices reasonable. Store has items from Joanna Gaines ( Fixer Upper) and much more. Finally a good home store in SB with reasonable prices.\n\n\n\n\nMy brother came to visit and we wanted to pick up a six pack of good beers for a night in. Ended up staying and having a few while playing their Nintendo 64 (Super Smash Brothers, which the owner said was donated by fellow patrons). It's a great place with good food and genuinely nice people. Should be a staple in the Northeast.\n\n\n\n\nMy go to menu is coconut soup and pad thai with protein. I tried same menu here. \nActually really like their coconut soup. They used enough amount of coconut milk that soup was really creamy and wasn't over powering with herb. I am so used to Americanized thai cuisine that I prefer less herb on my dish except cilantro.\nPat thai was great too. Liked the amount of peanut they used, noodle was chewy and perfect and not too sweet. They gave me generous amount of chicken and white meat wasn't dry so I was very happy with my meal.\n\n\n\n\nExcellent service! Great diner food and breakfast is served all day. Came here for lunch- they were busy but very friendly and hospitable. Easy to get to off the 295.\n\n\n\n\nMy go-to spot on a Saturday night! I was real bummed that lucys closed, but was pleasantly surprised by this bar just across the street!\nTheir food is better than expected. I always get wings and fries. (be careful of the wtf sauce though) Sometimes it takes a real long time to get the bartenders attention, but the place is usually packed. And if you're lucky the always sunny crew will pop in!\n\n\n\n\nWe were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.\n\nHowever, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.\n\nThe special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  \n\nThe salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. \n\nBut enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. \n\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.\n\n\n\n\nI LOVE Weaver's Way and really disagree with some of the content in previous reviews. WW is not necessarily meant for convenience shopping. I am a single woman and I find that I have no trouble shopping at the co-op, during peak times or otherwise. I actually find the co-op to be a great place to shop if you live alone because I can get smaller quantities of items than if I shop at the corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children\", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family. I don't think that membership in a co-op is for everyone and, if you aren't single, it's definitely not a solo decision. If you're keen on being committed to the Weaver Way values, you couldn't find a better place to shop. If not, stick to the chain stores or just pay the 10% visitors' fee to pop in once in a while.\n\n\n\n\nHonestly the food doesn't knock my socks off but other people seem to love this place. I go because my husband likes it as for me I'd rather go to a different BBQ spot. I guess it also depends on what you order.\n\n\n\n\nThe TV shows are $4.99 and they have commercials! What a cheesy way to make money and a sign of a less than classy hotel, particularly when you pay more than $150 a night.  And there is NO complimentary breakfast, just an overpriced buffet, something even the cheapest hotels in California provide.\n\n\n\n\nI stopped here because it was by the hotel I was staying in. The guys working at the shop were super nice and friendly. I really like the buy one get one deal they do. I also ordered some hot wings and they were pretty good. They had a ton of sauce on them which is awesome. Next time I come back to town I will be sure to stop here for some more pizza!\n\n\n\n\nI've only had the cannolis here but they are awesome! They're freshly filled when ordered and the filling is phenomenal. Not too sweet, it's perfect. If you like cannoli, if you don't think you like cannoli, you should definitely get one from Termini Bros.\n\n\n\n\nTraveling through in our RV, stopped over in Granite City. Found this little gem of a cafe. Upon entering, the staff was very sweet and friendly. This is like home cooking. We ate here twice and all our food choices were fresh, delicious and like we would fix at home. Yum.\n\n\n\n\nAfter 3 weeks of working in the area I finally found a place off of Magazine that is not overrated. Friendly staff! Y'all know I love Phò so it's pretty damn good!\n\n\n\n\nOur family returned for breakfast again this weekend and the food and service was again impeccable ... Highly recommend\n\n\n\n\nThe kayaking tour at the Santa Cruz Island was great.  My husband and I had a wonderful time.  Jen, our tour guide, was helpful and informative.  We had a lot of fun exploring the caves.  We didn't expect much but this tour definitely exceeded our expectation.\n\n\n\n\nDefinitely recommend for anyone looking for a delicious meal at a reasonable price. The shrimp and goat cheese crepes are a must have!\n\n\n\n\nAfter living in the STL area for way over 10 years now, I am both ashamed and remorseful to admit that I ate here for the FIRST time just a few weeks ago. I am ashamed because it's a St. Louis tradition and remorseful because I missed out on it for so..many...years! \n\nThis place is amazing. What is not to love! It's a factory where you can get a tour (Friday-Sunday, noon-5pm on the hour), there's a shop, bar, and dining area. They also host many event with live music on the weekends. It's fun to just kind of wander and look around - don't worry, you'll get a chance because there will likely be a wait before you dine. The beer is, of course, amazing. The Hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great start for anyone who is not a huge beer drinker (like myself). Additionally, the food is homegrown and damn good. I had the pizza (recommendation from my server) and it was really spectacular, though I'm admittedly a pizza connoisseur so I enjoy a good pizza pie more than most probably ;P My date had a bison burger which was also really good. \n\nMore fun info: the service is great! I think they tend to hire more funky and alternative people (like tattoo parlor staff) which I support. The quality is what makes this place stand out along with the emphasis on local food and brewery. \n\nIt is a little on the pricier side but for all the experience you get and the quality, it is worth it. I will go again and again and you probably should, too!\n\n\n\n\nIf I could give it a zero, I would. I order a plain hamburger, and realized they put  bacon in it (which I am allergic to and unable to eat) after two bites. When I went back to the drive-through window to complain (didn't realize the actual restaurant was open--it was almost 2 after all...), the guy took back the burger, said nothing, and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly making conversation with the next people in line in their car, he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. Which I did. And still did not get an apology.\n\nI refuse to go back there after that ordeal, which is a shame, because it's nice to have a variety of places to go to after DT. Guess Freebirds it is!\n\n\n\n\nFirst time here and they did a great job, very satisfied with the car wash  and the service I received. Thank you\n\n\n\n\nI just started going to Sushi Nara this month (they opened just a short time ago).  I love this place; it is clean, the staff are friendly and acommodating, and the service is fast.  The sushi is always delicious ((I've been here 3 times) and the prices are reasonable. In fact, this week my husband stopped in for take out, bought 4 sushi rolls and the total was $24.  That is amazing.  \n\nI love the freshness of the food and there's a huge selection to choose from.\n\nEveryone on the eastside, check this place out!\n\n\n\n\nAwesome little shop.  The owner really knows his stuff and you can tell he loves his work.  They have tires and other parts you won't find anywhere else.\n\n\n\n\nBeen here so many times before and all I can say is the food is really good. A hidden gem in Florissant, it has the best Panang curry around. Haven't been to their sister restaurant yet, but I can't seem to want to move on when I am always so satisfied with their fare here.\n\n\n\n\nMy food only merited maybe two stars but I will give an extra star because I like the menu (and will try more of it) and their design and concept.  Sadly though, my tomato-basil soup tasted kind of like a weak marinara and my tuna melt type sandwich had a very sharp, off-putting flavor.  It was citrusy, for sure, and I love lemon in a tuna melt but perhaps this was lemon zest or something just way too overpowering?  I think next time I will focus on the dishes with cured Italian meats, mortadella and prosciutto.  And also the baked goods, those sounded pretty good, especially the Nutella bruschetta!\n\n\n\n\nWe visited once and were very disappointed in my veggie pizza and my husband's sub sandwich.  The tomato sauce was not tasty, and they did not use enough cheese on my pizza.  The dough looked and tasted like it was prepared by a machine.  Perhaps they have improved, but we are not in any rush to try a second time.\n\n\n\n\nA couple friends and I stopped by for some late night milkshakes and found ourselves at More Than Just Ice Cream. Well, we just got ice cream...not fully taking advantage of what the name implies, but maybe next time.\n\n3 milkshakes: 1 coffee, 1 chocolate, and 1 black&white malt. \n\nAll were pretty good. Definitely satisfied the ice cream craving. I thought my coffee milkshake could have been thicker, same goes for the chocolate. The black&white was plenty thick and was probably the best of the three. Unfortunately, I did not order that one so I settled for my not so creamy coffee.\n\nI did sample some ice cream flavors before setting on a milkshake. I tried the pumpkin pie which was AMAZING. I don't know why I didn't just get this. Maybe a milkshake isn't the way to go here.\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I took my mother here for her 100th birthday!\nWe can't say enough about the treatment we received: from a great table and view, to delicious \"compliments of the chef\" extra dishes, to a beautifully decorated cake plate, to the warm and attentive servers. It was much more than we expected, even for this very special occasion. For us, it was a wonderfully memorable experience.\n\n\n\n\nMan. This place is nice. The bartender was awesome. Try the burger. It's fresh with all local ingredients. The plates of food I saw come out looked amazing as well. \n\nThe beer is cold. The drinks are mixed perfectly.  This is not a chain restaurant but a dedicated local place with good employees.\n\n\n\n\nI visited this restaurant 4 times during my 5 days stay. Crazy, right? Here are a list of reasons/pros:\n\n- We were staying a nearby hotel.\n- The restaurant opens 11 - 10:30 pretty much every day including new year's day so it fits into our schedule.\n- If you are a party of two, chances are you get seated right away.\n- $9 per dozen of oysters which is a really great deal by any standard!\n- They have a seafood shop next door that sells boiled and fresh seafood to- go.\n- Our server (same) is very friendly and recognized us every single time.\n\nNow I want to talk about the reasons why I only give it 3 stars.\n\n- We tried a bunch of stuff which are all pretty mediocre. Raw oysters are not cleaned well. So if your schedule is flexible, go to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for their 50 cents/oyster - better quality and cheaper. Turtle soup has a strange taste so I definitely prefer Felix's. A portion of my boiled shrimps are always mushy somhow, maybe boiled for too long?...\n- The ambient is inviting but not comfortable so we basically just finished our food and go. \n- Clean the bathroom!!\n\nWill probably visit again if we stay in the area next time or simply just pick up some seafood quickly.\n\n\n\n\nSkip this train wreck if you are looking for dinner.  Our server was clueless...like we seriously thought she was lost in the restaurant.  Had to ask for setups, water refills, etc.  Ordered chicken parmesan and got eggplant parmesan instead with a fish bone in it.  The drinks were good.\n\n\n\n\nMeh is all I can say for TDS. The restaurant itself is just cold.... not literally, but figuratively. There was no decor, no menu boards, stainless steel prep tables as dining tables, no soda machines, staff EVERYWHERE with no identification (shirts, nametags, etc). The food is reasonably priced and most of it was quite good, but what really irked my party was the fact that they charge for extra salsa!!! We ordered a salsa trio (which included 3 samples of the various salsas, in 2oz glass prep bowls), and when my brother asked for more salsa for his tacos (mind you, we ordered one of ever taco, three burritos and guacamole), he was told he'd have to buy the trio again! Really!!??? We spent over $40 on food, drinks and apps, too. Even though the food was decent, I wouldn't return as the atmosphere is just blah and you can't get extra salsa for your damn tacos!\n\n\n\n\nI'm so incredibly happy with our pictures! Angela Clifton Photography have worked with us 3 times and we have been happy with every single picture that was taken! Not only are the photos fabulous, but we had such a fun experience. The price is extremely reasonable and the pictures will be a keepsake we will cherish forever!\n\n\n\n\nEnjoyed my fish out at a sidewalk table.  A bit pricey but food was good.  Go to Side street in French quarter if u want quieter dining outside.\n\n\n\n\nThe court house is very old and the art is great. The spiral staircase is funny. One can get view of entire city from 5th level. The tower clock room is really surprising with all mechanical gears inside!! You need a prior appointment to get into clock room. Worth spending 2 to 3 hours of time here.\n\n\n\n\nI had the pleasure to meet with Ann today and not only was she extremely helpful and so positive, she went above and beyond to make my 1st experience here amazing and made it a absolute regular customer from this day forward. Thanks girlie!!\n\n\n\n\nThis is the first time I tried this place and  I was surprisingly surprised. I had a combination dinner pad Thai and coconut soup. The soup was very tasty as I never had coconut soup before. The pad Thai was exactly what I was expecting and it did not disappoint. The restaurant had great Thai decor and music. The staff and service was top notch. For a town with not much selection for food, this was a great change of pace. This may become my go to place in Carp.\n\n\n\n\nThis place was so chill and relaxing. When I come back it'll definitely be in my list if stops. Not to mention the artist performing was fun and eclectic  (I mean really, a country version of \"Let It Go\", what's not to love?)\n\n\n\n\nId you haven't been to the Smoothie King center since it was know as the New Orleans Arena, you are in for a nice surprise. The arena has had a face lift and, while the seats are the same,  everything else has been refreshed.   \n\nMost importantly,  the food options are far more varied and appeal to many tastes.  The quality of the food is very good and significantly improved from a few years back. The drink options are much improved as well and include full service bars, spiked lemonade,  bottled and draft beer and of course, smoothies.  There is even a spot for sweets. You can get funnel cake, cotton candy, and all kinds of delicious things I was too full to take in.  \n\nThe venue finally feels a bit swanky and top notch.  We are moving on up!\n\n\n\n\nDon't know what it is but If my tummy's feeling icky, I can count on Chipotle's stake to fix me up. I just have to remember not to go during full on lunch time. I usually go between 2 & 4 when it's peaceful and calm. Busy or not the service is always friendly and fast!\n\n\n\n\nI must admit, I wasn't expecting much. This place totally blew us away. This has to be one of the best Indian restaurants in the Tampa Bay. The ambience is wonderful including white table linens. The best part was the food, OMG. The chicken 65 was to die for, and the hot sour soup was rich and flavorful. The waitress (Angel) was friendly,  attentive and very pleasant. They opened just a week ago. I'm sure this will soon be the place foodies seek out for real Indian food.\n\n\n\n\nHad to wait until my third trip to NOLA to actually get in the door.  First two times I tried waiting in line, this time around we got smart and bought reserved seats so we could be on the benches. Well worth the extra $20 to not hassle with waiting in line for an hour. It goes toward the preservation of Jazz so it's a good cause...just splurge.\n\nThe show was fantastic.  True musicians and great personalities to boot. I can only imagine that this is what concerts were like 50 years ago. The band members were dapper, engaging and insanely talented.  It's in a tiny hole in the wall space that only holds maybe 200 people? So it's very intimate and nice to see the smiles on the faces of the musicians as they share their craft with you. This is a must do while in NOLA!\n\n\n\n\nA GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!  I was a completely new customer.  I did not have an appointment because my other plans got rained out and my dealership was too busy to take me.  I needed a PA State & Emissions  inspection which I dread because they can be a total ripoff at some places when they add things on and I just wanted to get it over with.  I saw that this place had much better reviews on Yelp than many other shops in the area.  Keystone Discount Tire took my 2008 Pontiac Torrent in for inspection while I waited and had some free coffee.  I only had to get up once to look at some irregular outer front tire wear on my car when it was on the rack during inspection.  I always appreciate it when the technician lets me look at the problem.   It was nothing major.  Easily correctable with an alignment sometime in the future.  Bill was very friendly, knowledgable, and straightforward with his overall analysis of my car.  My car was fully inspected and stickered in less than an hour without my bill being jacked up with add-ons.   I recommend getting on their mailing list for their coupons!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\n\nWow! I never thought my sons phone could be repaired after he dropped it but it is and it took less than a half an hour! Very professional and excellent service! I'm thrilled!\n\n\n\n\nService and management terrible... After messing up all 4 of our orders the waiter got mad and started cursing... The manager offered our drinks to be free.. What a mess. The food was cold and nasty didn't even eat half of it and waited over an hour... I will never dine in any cracker barrel again after this experience...\n\n\n\n\nI have been to a number of dog friendly hotels...just not in the city and did not know what to expect. Usually they are motel like.  This one was in the heart of the city.\n\nI walked tentatively into the hotel lobby as i have a labrador/golden mix who is not easy to hide.\n\nWe got to the front desk to register and i was still feeling uneasy although my  bf had assured me it was a dog friendly hotel. Reception was so nice immediately putting us at ease. As we checked in an attendant asked if Bentley could have treats which she fullly enjoyed. The Reception person also asked if we would like a welcome kit for Bentley. Holy moly. Of course. Dog dishes, a mat, treats, etc. I was blown away.  \n\nPlus the guests at the hotel all stopped to compliment and pet \"queen Bentley\". Our room was on the top floor. Awesome!\n\nEven when i went to walk her the car attendants greeted her by name. We were so impressed with the service we decided to come back an extra night. \n\nThank you Loews. I didnt realize a hotel could be so dog friendly especially to a big dog.\n\n\n\n\n",

I actually thought we were just going to tour through the cemetery, but she took us around the French Quarter for the first hour, and the cemetery for the second half of the tour. You'll meet up in front of a grocery store (seems strange at first, but it's not terribly hard to find, and it'll give you a chance to get some water), and you'll stop at a visitor center part way through the tour for a bathroom break if needed. This tour was one of my favorite parts of my trip!",

The cheese was good, but none of the other toppings added much flavor.  There was no red sauce as is typical for a true margherita pizza.  My opinion is that Upland's pizza might serve as a nice appetizer for a group, but I'll be sticking with their burgers or tenderloins as my meal of choice on future visits.",

I LOVE the 96th street Naked Tchopstix so I was very excited to see this one which is closer to my house.\nThe vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it.\nMy daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry and it was quite yummy. Next time I am going to try the vanilla chai.",

The casino area is huge, rivaling almost anything you could find in Las Vegas.  One thing we noticed is that many of the slot machines were noted as being penny machines, but when you actually started to play them you realized they had minimum bets of anywhere from 30 cents to $5.  Talk about false advertising!  We were in the Tuscany Tower on the 12th floor.  Our room had a nice view of the huge pool area.  Our room was large and featured free WiFi (likewise always appreciated), a huge bathroom area with large shower (with two shower heads), TV, a large jetted bathtub and a phone next to the commode.  There were dual sinks and lots of counter space.  Plenty of towels were supplied.  The roomy main area had a king bed with night stands, closet, TV, mini fridge, dresser with two drawers, a safe, table for computer or writing, complimentary bottles of water, and three nicely upholstered chairs and table.  The thermostat did a good job controlling the temperature and keeping it comfortable.  Staff were all courteous and helpful.  A very nice place and we enjoyed our stay.",

As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn't be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced.",

Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. \nI also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.",

The flavor was good, but I don't think we'd order them again. We got the green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai. Both of those dishes were great, but the duck stole the show. That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late). Another person who got take-out was missing one of their items (but the owner realized it and called him and walked the dish to his house, which was very nice). Overall, good quality Thai!

The reason I think she is so great is that she knows what will look best on me and over the past year has understood my limits for styles. I always go into the salon and tell her to cut my hair how she thinks will look best, and I always leave blown away at what she does. You know you have a great stylist when you don't have to specify what you want done, but instead they see what needs to be done. Great stylist, great personality and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend her to anyone who wants to look their best.",

      "interview_data": "I LOVE Weaver's Way and really disagree with some of the content in previous reviews. WW is not necessarily meant for convenience shopping. I am a single woman and I find that I have no trouble shopping at the co-op, during peak times or otherwise. I actually find the co-op to be a great place to shop if you live alone because I can get smaller quantities of items than if I shop at the corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children\", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family. I don't think that membership in a co-op is for everyone and, if you aren't single, it's definitely not a solo decision. If you're keen on being committed to the Weaver Way values, you couldn't find a better place to shop. If not, stick to the chain stores or just pay the 10% visitors' fee to pop in once in a while.",

I saw that this place had much better reviews on Yelp than many other shops in the area.  Keystone Discount Tire took my 2008 Pontiac Torrent in for inspection while I waited and had some free coffee.  I only had to get up once to look at some irregular outer front tire wear on my car when it was on the rack during inspection.  I always appreciate it when the technician lets me look at the problem.   It was nothing major.  Easily correctable with an alignment sometime in the future.  Bill was very friendly, knowledgable, and straightforward with his overall analysis of my car.  My car was fully inspected and stickered in less than an hour without my bill being jacked up with add-ons.   I recommend getting on their mailing list for their coupons!!!!!!!!!!",

  "input_docs": "Straight to the point, it's cheap, it tastes and feels cheap. The good: price, location, dessert (recommended food items are: baked chicken, fried chicken, potatoes, Salad, meat and cheese, pizza) also our waitress was great. The normal: behind the counter meat slicing station, shrimp (not even deshelled), Mexican station. The bad: breakfast -worst eggs ever, actually worst, eggs. The chef can't even cut through ham or hard bread (tried on all 3 occasions), beef, shrimp again. As for decoration, it's the 1970 nightmare you can imagine. \n\n\nWe started with the burger set, a big mistake. It was cold and the fries were old. Mentioned to our waitress, but nothing came of it.  We ordered a large thin pizza which was a bit pricey after adding toppings. Pizza was ok, not great. Aside from not being our advocate, our server was good.  I have been here before for a football game, it was better then. Will try another venue next time.\n\n\nThis is a so-called restaurant that doesn't do anything a restaurant should do except preparing food, the rest is left to the guest. Do you want water? Get up and go across the yard to get it. If you want a drink, go downstairs and pay in cash. Want to sit in dirty deckchairs in a dirty garden, enjoy yourself. The waiters are a little bit helpful as they bring you your food after you go to the window and pay cash for it. Kind of like New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but dirty and with live music (which is nice). It's a once in a lifetime experience for me... just once.\n\n\nMy brother came to visit and we wanted to pick up a six pack of good beer for one night. We ended up staying and having a few while playing their Nintendo 64 (Super Smash Brothers which the owner said was donated by other customers). It's a great place with good food and really nice people. Should be a staple in the Northeast.\n\n\nMy menu is coconut soup and pat thai with protein. I tried the same menu here. Actually really like their coconut soup. They used enough coconut milk that the soup was really creamy and not overpowered with herbs. I'm so used to Americanized Thai cuisine that I prefer fewer herbs on my dish. Pat Thai was great too. I liked the amount of peanuts they used, the noodles were chewy and perfect and not too sweet. They gave me a generous amount of chicken and white meat was not dry so I was very happy with my meal.\n\n\nI stopped here because it was close to the hotel I was staying at. The people working in the store were super nice and friendly. I like the buy one get one offer they do. I also ordered some hot wings and they were pretty good. They had a ton of sauce which is awesome. Next time I come back to town I will definitely stop here for more pizza!\n\n\nJust started going to Sushi Nara this month (they only recently opened). I love this place; It's clean, the staff is friendly and courteous, and the service is quick. The sushi is always delicious (I've been here 3 times) and the prices are reasonable. In fact, my husband stopped by for take out this week, bought 4 sushi rolls and the total price was $24. That's incredible. I love the freshness of the food and there is a huge variety. Everyone on the east side, check out this place!\n\n\nWe had a party of 6 here for hibachi. Our waitress put our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn't really tell who was who and forgot several items on one order. I understand that I made mistakes but the restaurant was very quiet so we were a bit surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our chef said maybe three words but he cooked very well, his name was Francisco. The service was lazy, the food was pretty good and I hope it was just a free night here. But for the money I wouldn't go again.\n",

  "input_docs": "Straight to the point, it's cheap, it tastes and feels cheap. The good: price, location, dessert (recommended food items are: baked chicken, fried chicken, potatoes, Salad, meat and cheese, pizza) also our waitress was great. The normal: behind the counter meat slicing station, shrimp (not even deshelled), Mexican station. The bad: breakfast -worst eggs ever, actually worst, eggs. The chef can't even cut through ham or hard bread (tried on all 3 occasions), beef, shrimp again. As for decoration, it's the 1970 nightmare you can imagine. \n\n\nWe started with the burger set, a big mistake. It was cold and the fries were old. Mentioned to our waitress, but nothing came of it.  We ordered a large thin pizza which was a bit pricey after adding toppings. Pizza was ok, not great. Aside from not being our advocate, our server was good.  I have been here before for a football game, it was better then. Will try another venue next time.\n\n\nThis is a so-called restaurant that doesn't do anything a restaurant should do except preparing food, the rest is left to the guest. Do you want water? Get up and go across the yard to get it. If you want a drink, go downstairs and pay in cash. Want to sit in dirty deckchairs in a dirty garden, enjoy yourself. The waiters are a little bit helpful as they bring you your food after you go to the window and pay cash for it. Kind of like New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but dirty and with live music (which is nice). It's a once in a lifetime experience for me... just once.\n\n\nMy brother came to visit and we wanted to pick up a six pack of good beer for one night. We ended up staying and having a few while playing their Nintendo 64 (Super Smash Brothers which the owner said was donated by other customers). It's a great place with good food and really nice people. Should be a staple in the Northeast.\n\n\nMy menu is coconut soup and pat thai with protein. I tried the same menu here. Actually really like their coconut soup. They used enough coconut milk that the soup was really creamy and not overpowered with herbs. I'm so used to Americanized Thai cuisine that I prefer fewer herbs on my dish. Pat Thai was great too. I liked the amount of peanuts they used, the noodles were chewy and perfect and not too sweet. They gave me a generous amount of chicken and white meat was not dry so I was very happy with my meal.\n\n\nI stopped here because it was close to the hotel I was staying at. The people working in the store were super nice and friendly. I like the buy one get one offer they do. I also ordered some hot wings and they were pretty good. They had a ton of sauce which is awesome. Next time I come back to town I will definitely stop here for more pizza!\n\n\nJust started going to Sushi Nara this month (they only recently opened). I love this place; It's clean, the staff is friendly and courteous, and the service is quick. The sushi is always delicious (I've been here 3 times) and the prices are reasonable. In fact, my husband stopped by for take out this week, bought 4 sushi rolls and the total price was $24. That's incredible. I love the freshness of the food and there is a huge variety. Everyone on the east side, check out this place!\n\n\nWe had a party of 6 here for hibachi. Our waitress put our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn't really tell who was who and forgot several items on one order. I understand that I made mistakes but the restaurant was very quiet so we were a bit surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our chef said maybe three words but he cooked very well, his name was Francisco.
