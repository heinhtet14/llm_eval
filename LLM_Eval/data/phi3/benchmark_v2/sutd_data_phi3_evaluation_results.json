The good: price, location, dessert (recommended food items are: baked chicken, fried chicken, potatoes, Salad, meat and cheese, pizza) also our waitress was great. The normal: behind the counter meat slicing station, shrimp (not even deshelled), Mexican station. The bad: breakfast -worst eggs ever, actually worst, eggs. The chef can't even cut through ham or hard bread (tried on all 3 occasions), beef, shrimp again. As for decoration, it's the 1970 nightmare you can imagine.",
